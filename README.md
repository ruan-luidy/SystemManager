## What it is

SysManager is a local-first desktop tool for keeping an eye on a Windows PC.
It rolls network diagnostics, system health, Windows Update, app management
(updates, bulk install, uninstall), privacy controls, context menu management,
secure file shredding, driver inventory, safe deep cleanup, and a readable
Event Log viewer into a single tabbed WPF app.

Everything runs on the machine itself. No cloud, no telemetry, no account.

> **When SysManager uses the network.** There is no background phone-home — the app
> never sends usage data. Network access only happens for features you explicitly
> use: the network diagnostics (ping / traceroute / speed test), and downloading an app
> you chose to install via winget. App icons in the Bulk Installer are an **opt-in**
> extra — off by default, and only when you tick "Load app icons from the web" does it
> fetch them from Google's favicon service. Nothing else leaves your PC.
>
> The one call SysManager makes on its own is the version check: at startup it asks
> GitHub's public releases page which release is newest, so it can tell you when a fix
> is available. Nothing about you or your PC is sent. It runs at most once a day, and
> the About tab has a checkbox — "Check GitHub for a new version when SysManager
> starts" — that switches it off entirely. The **Check for updates** button still works
> on demand either way.
>
> The local diagnostic log keeps 14 days of rolling files in
> `%LocalAppData%\SysManager\logs`, and your Windows user name is replaced with `[user]`
> in every line — including inside error messages — so a log you choose to share does
> not carry your account name with it.

Built with gamers in mind — live ping overlays for CS2, FACEIT, PUBG and streaming
endpoints, Steam/Epic/Battle.net/Riot/GOG/EA launcher cache cleanup, and
an honest "is it my PC, my ISP, or the server?" verdict.

Beyond those, the rest of the 59 tabs cover performance tuning, DNS and hosts editing, duplicate files,
battery health, processes with plain-English descriptions, startup entries, shortcut cleanup, app blocking,
new-install alerts and Windows optional features. [The full list is below](#features), grouped as the sidebar
groups them.

## Why SysManager?

Most Windows utilities do one thing, or bundle telemetry and upsells. SysManager
is a single, local-first app that covers the whole maintenance surface — and it's
fully open source.

<sub>**BleachBit is here because it is the rival that ties on the rows above.** A table whose top three rows
exclude the best-known open-source Windows cleaner is cherry-picked, and a reader who knows BleachBit spots
that immediately. Its ⚠️ cells are specifics, not hedges: it ships a portable **zip** of many files rather
than one `.exe`; it cleans tracking data thoroughly but does not toggle Windows' own telemetry settings; and
its current Windows release publishes a detached GPG signature for the zip rather than stating an Authenticode
signature, which is a different thing from what stops the SmartScreen warning. Licences differ — SysManager is
MIT, BleachBit is GPL-3.0 — which is why that row no longer names one.</sub>

<sub>The signing row is the one where SysManager loses, and it is here on purpose — a table a project wins
every row of tells you nothing. Builds are unsigned, so Windows shows a warning on first launch. Why, what

## Features

### Sidebar navigation
The sidebar organises 59 feature tabs into 12 groups — 11 collapsible groups
plus a flat top-level Dashboard entry — so you can find what you need without
scrolling through a flat list. The active tab stays marked with an accent bar,
selected background, and stronger label while you move between groups. Every tab
row and every group header is also keyboard-operable with a visible focus cue. All
59 tabs are fully implemented:

| Group | Tabs |
|-------|------|
| 🏠 Dashboard | Dashboard |
| 🔧 System | System Health · Windows Update · Performance Mode · Services · Startup Manager · Windows Features · Restore Points · Task Scheduler · Boot Analyzer · System Fixes · Tweaks Hub 🔬 |
| 🎮 Gaming & Profiles | Gaming Profile 🔬 · Standby List Cleaner · Timer Resolution · CPU Core Affinity · Display Profiles |
| 📊 Monitor | Process Manager · Resource History 🔬 · Camera/Mic/Location · Settings Watchdog 🔬 |
| 🧹 Cleanup | Quick Cleanup · Deep Cleanup · Shortcut Cleaner · Scheduled Maintenance 🔬 |
| 💾 Storage & Files | Disk Analyzer · Large Files · Duplicate Finder · File Lock Detector |
| 🌐 Network | Ping · Traceroute · Speed Test · Bandwidth Monitor · Network Repair · DNS & Hosts |
| 📦 Apps | App Updates · Bulk Installer · New App Alerts · Uninstaller |
| 🛡️ Privacy & Security | Privacy & Telemetry · File Shredder · App Blocker · Preinstalled Apps · Browser Cleaner · Edge/OneDrive Remover · Defender Tweaks |
| 🎨 Customization | Context Menu · Dark Mode Scheduler · Volume Control · Notification Blocker 🔬 |
| ℹ️ Info | Drivers · Battery Health · System Logs · System Report · Legacy Panels · About |
| ⚙️ Advanced | Profile Export / Import · CLI Interface 🔬 · Environment Variables |

> 🔬 = Preview — fully implemented and usable, marked in-app while it settles in.

**Search finds any tab in your own words.** The box at the top of the sidebar matches what you would
actually type, not just the tab's name: "slow startup" finds Boot Analyzer, "popups" finds Notification
Blocker, "webcam" finds Camera/Mic/Location, "cannot delete" finds File Lock Detector, "free up space"
finds Deep Cleanup. 55 of the 59 tabs carry keywords for this; typing clears the groups and shows a flat
list of matches with a count, and clearing the box brings the groups back.

Groups expand and collapse with a click. **Cleanup opens with the app** — every group
used to start collapsed, so the first screen showed twelve category names and not one
feature. Only one group opens, because the viewport has room for exactly one: at a
820px window the twelve collapsed groups already fill almost all of it, so expanding a
second pushes category headings out of sight. Collapsed groups show a child count
badge, a written one-line summary of what the group covers, and a tooltip with the
full list. Dashboard renders as a flat top-level entry without an expander arrow.
Each tab shows a slim progress bar under its name when performing a
long-running operation, so you always know which tab is working.

### Theme customization
A palette button in the top-right corner opens an appearance popup with:
- **Dark mode** — 6 curated presets (Midnight Indigo, Deep Ocean, Dark Forest, Neon Rose, Violet Night, Warm Ember)
- **Light mode** — 6 curated presets (Clean Indigo, Sky Breeze, Warm Sand, Mint Fresh, Soft Blossom, Lavender)
- **Auto mode** — follow the Windows light/dark setting, and keep following it. It changes with Windows
  while the app is open, whether you flip it by hand, on a Windows schedule, or from SysManager's own
  Dark Mode tab. Your colour family is kept across the switch: on Warm Ember, going light gives you
  Warm Sand rather than the default. Picking any preset turns Auto off
- **Custom mode** — free hex input for accent, background, surface, and text colors
- Background shade slider for fine-tuning lightness/darkness
- **Reset to default theme** — one click back to the shipped dark theme and shade, from any mode
- Settings persist between sessions. If they cannot be read when SysManager starts, a change
  applies for that session but is not saved over them

Custom colours cannot make the app unreadable. Text is adjusted to stay legible against every surface
it lands on, and a panel colour that leaves no room for readable text at all — a near-white card on a
near-black background, say — is nudged toward the background until it does. The twelve built-in themes
are unaffected by that correction; their surfaces already sit near their backgrounds. If a result is
still not what you wanted, Reset to default theme puts the shipped theme back and survives a restart.

Graph lines follow the theme rather than fighting it. The Ping, Bandwidth Monitor and Resource
History charts each draw with a fixed set of colours — blue is CPU, purple is memory — and those
colours were chosen against a dark card. Switching to a light theme darkens each line by exactly as
much as it needs to stay at 3:1 against the card it is drawn on, so the line remains followable
without a second palette to maintain and without changing which colour means what. Brightness moves,
hue does not; on the six dark presets, where the original colours already clear the bar, nothing
changes at all.

### Keyboard navigation
The app is operable without a mouse, and the control you are on is always visible. `Tab` moves
forward, `Shift+Tab` back, `Space` presses a button or ticks a checkbox, and the arrow keys move
within a table or a row of filter chips. In the sidebar, `Enter` also opens the tab or group you are
on, the way it opens a folder in File Explorer. Opening the appearance panel moves focus into it, `Tab`
cycles the themes inside it, and `Escape` closes it and puts focus back on the button you opened it from.

`Escape` also stops whatever the open tab is doing — a disk scan, a cleanup, a speed test — on all
16 tabs that can be cancelled. It only acts while something is running, and only after the control you are
on has had its own chance to use the key, so it still closes a drop-down or undoes a text edit first.

**`F5` re-reads the tab you are on**, across all 41 tabs that have something to look at again — the
process list, the startup entries, the event log, the installed apps. Each tab names its own refresh, so
F5 runs exactly what its own toolbar button runs and nothing else: nothing that cleans, deletes, applies
or uninstalls is reachable from a bare keypress. Pressing it during a refresh that is already running
does nothing rather than starting a second one.

**`Ctrl+F` jumps to the search box** on the 12 tabs that have one, and selects whatever is already
typed there so you can replace it straight away — the same thing the key does in a browser. On a tab with
nothing to filter it does nothing at all, rather than moving your caret somewhere unexpected.

**`F1` opens About**, where the version, the release notes, "Report a problem" and "Ask a question" all
live. The same place is one click away from the `?` chip at the bottom of the sidebar, beside the
appearance button. Both exist because everything a stuck person needs was already in About and none of it
was findable: About is the last entry in the eleventh of twelve sidebar groups, and every group except
Cleanup starts closed. Unlike the three keys above, F1 works immediately — it does not wait for the tab
you are on to be ready, because a key you press when you are lost has to answer on the first frame.

The focus outline is deliberately two thin lines of opposite shade — one light, one dark — rather
than a single accent-coloured ring. A single colour cannot be visible everywhere: it has to show up
on a purple primary button, a red delete button, a grey secondary button and a plain card, and any
one colour disappears against at least one of those. With two, one line always contrasts whatever is
underneath. Measured across all 12 themes, the outline stays at 4.5:1 or better against every surface
it is drawn on — above the 3:1 WCAG asks of a non-text indicator.

**Every button is at least 28 by 28 pixels**, however small its label. Every button in the app that sets its
own padding — 110 of them — was rendered and measured, and **30 came out smaller than the 24 by 24 that WCAG
2.5.8 asks for**, spread across 16 screens. The worst was the **X that removes an entry from your hosts
file**, at 20 by 19: the smallest target in the app and one of the few that deletes something. There is now a
floor on the shared button style, so a cramped label makes a button narrow to look at and not to click. 28
rather than 24, because a floor set exactly at the threshold leaves nothing for a fractional display scale,
and because 28 is already the size of the small round buttons at the bottom of the sidebar.

### Screen readers
The six controls that do something you cannot take back explain themselves, not just their label. Landing on
Shred All announces the button and then "Overwrites every item in the list so it cannot be recovered, then
deletes it. This cannot be undone, not even from the Recycle Bin." The same goes for Uninstall selected, Kill
process, Delete preset, Delete selected shortcuts, and the Run as administrator button that appears on the 31
pages needing elevation.

Before that, the red colour and the confirmation dialog were the only warnings, and neither reaches someone
who cannot see the screen — the dialog arrives after the button has already been pressed. The explanation is
not a tooltip for the same reason: a tooltip needs a mouse hovering over the control, so it never reaches
someone who tabbed to it, and it is not reliably handed to assistive software. It is kept to those six
deliberately. An explanation on every button in the app would make it slower to navigate, not clearer.

Every tab also reads out what it is doing as it works. The line at the bottom of each tab — "Scanning…",
"Removed 1,204 files", "Scan complete." — is announced on all 53 tabs that have one, as are the SFC and DISM
results when a system repair finishes and Deep Cleanup's scan and clean summaries. Announcements are polite,
so they wait their turn rather than cutting across whatever you are reading.

What is deliberately *not* announced matters just as much. Deep Cleanup's percentage changes several times a
second and its current folder changes per directory; the repair ETAs tick continuously. Reading those aloud
would talk over you without telling you anything, so each tab announces the coarsest line it has and leaves
the fast-moving numbers on screen only. Both halves of that are enforced by a test, because a change that
announced everything would look like an improvement.

### Context Menu Manager
Manage Windows Explorer right-click entries — toggle them on or off without
deleting anything. Plain menu entries use the standard `LegacyDisable` registry
mechanism; add-ons use Windows' own blocked-extensions list. Neither removes
anything a program registered, so both are undone by turning the switch back on:
- **Presets:** Win10 Default (classic full menu), Win11 Default (modern compact), Custom
- The preset currently applied is marked with a tick, so you can see which style you are on without applying one
- Selecting a preset resets to clean defaults, disabling third-party entries — re-enable individually
- **Win10/Win11 style toggle** — switch between classic and modern menu (restarts Explorer)
- **Visual preview on hover** — real screenshots of each menu style
- **Entry explanations** — human-readable descriptions for common entries
- **Add-ons listed too** — the COM shell extensions that programs like archivers, cloud sync
  clients and antivirus install are shown alongside the plain menu entries. These are the ones
  that make a right-click take a second to open, because Explorer loads each add-on's DLL and
  waits for it before drawing the menu. A **"Type" column** says which kind each row is, and an
  add-on's row names the program behind it instead of the raw class id
- **Add-ons can be switched off too** — hiding one adds its class id to the blocked-extensions list
  Windows checks before loading a shell add-on, which is the same reversible mechanism Autoruns
  writes. Nothing the program installed is deleted; switching the row back on removes the entry.
  It is a machine-wide setting, so it needs administrator rights, and the row's tooltip says so
  before you click
- **Restart Explorer button** — Explorer decides which add-ons to load when it starts, so a blocked
  add-on is still in the menu until it restarts. The button does it after confirming, rather than
  leaving you to conclude the switch did nothing
- **Windows' own add-ons stay out of the way** — an add-on implemented from inside the Windows
  folder is treated as a system entry: hidden behind "Show system entries" and never touched by a
  preset. Presets only ever change plain menu entries, so one click cannot block every add-on on
  the machine
- **"Applies to" column** — shows whether the entry affects Files, Folders, Files and folders,
  Desktop, or Directory Background
- **HKCU fallback** — system-protected entries can be toggled via user-level registry override
- Admin elevation banner with one-click restart as administrator

### Environment Variables
Edit Windows environment variables without the cramped built-in dialog:
- **User and System scopes in one grid** — filter by scope, search by name or value
- **In-place value editing**, plus add and remove variables
- **Dedicated PATH editor** for PATH-like variables — reorder directories, remove
  entries, and strip duplicates in one click
- **Missing folders highlighted** so you can spot dead PATH entries at a glance
- **Local until Apply:** changes are staged and each scope gets a one-time safety
  snapshot before its first write. New User snapshots stay under HKCU; System
  snapshots use access-controlled HKLM storage, and only that protected source can
  restore machine-wide variables
- Changes broadcast to Windows, so new terminals pick them up without a reboot
- System-scope edits need administrator rights (standard elevation banner); user
  variables can be edited without it

### Dark Mode Scheduler
- **Switch the Windows light/dark theme** instantly — apps only, or the taskbar
  and Start too
- **Schedule it** — set a dark time and a light time (e.g. 19:00 / 07:00) and the
  theme follows automatically; handles the overnight switch correctly
- Applies immediately with no sign-out, no admin needed, and is fully reversible
- **Honest about its limits** — the schedule runs while SysManager (or its tray)
  is open; it's not a background Windows service
- If the saved schedule cannot be read when SysManager starts, a change still applies but
  is not saved over it, and the status line says so

### Volume Control
- **Per-app volume mixer** — lists every app currently playing on your default
  playback device, each with its own volume slider, mute toggle, and a live peak meter
- **Live and lightweight** — the app list reconciles on a ~1-second loop and the meters
  update on a shared timer, both paused while the tab is hidden so it costs nothing in
  the background. The refresh never replaces a message on the status line, so a saved preset
  or a change Windows refused stays there until you do something else
- **Real names and icons** — resolved from each audio session's process (with a safe
  fallback for protected processes), including the Windows "system sounds" session
- **Per-app output routing** — send one app to your headset and another to your speakers.
  Where Windows exposes the routing interface, each app gets an output-device picker in the
  row; on builds where it doesn't, the row shows a "Choose output device…" button that opens
  Windows' per-app sound settings so you're never left without a path. Plug a headset in while
  the tab is open and it appears on its own — the device list is re-read every ten seconds, and
  each app keeps the destination you picked for it. Windows does not report which device an app
  is currently using, so the picker says "Choose a device" rather than guessing: the override
  you set stays in force in Windows, but SysManager will not claim to know it after a restart
- **Volume presets** — save the current per-app volumes and mutes as a named preset (e.g.
  "Gaming", "Focus") and re-apply it in one click; presets are keyed by app so they work
  across restarts, and are stored locally in `%LocalAppData%\SysManager`. The summary counts
  only the apps Windows actually changed, and says how many it refused — an app that has
  just stopped playing, for example. A preset that could not be saved or deleted says so, and
  saved presets that cannot be read are never written over
- **Tray shortcut** — a "Volume mixer" item in the system-tray menu opens the app straight
  to this tab, alongside shortcuts to Process Manager and Quick Cleanup

### System Logs (Windows Event Log, friendly)
- Browse System, Application, Security, and Setup logs
- Each event gets a plain-English explanation and recommended next steps
- Filter by severity and time range, plus full-text search
- Mark any event with the flag button to keep it findable while you keep scrolling or
  change filters. "Clear marks" removes them all, including any a filter is hiding
- Export to CSV, with a "search online" link for unknown events
- The Security log requires administrator rights. Without them the page says so
  outright rather than showing an empty list that looks like "no events"

### System Report
- One-click, read-only snapshot of the whole machine: OS, CPU, memory
  (with per-slot module detail), GPU, motherboard, storage health, and active
  network adapters
- Storage section carries SMART detail when available — temperature, wear %,
  and power-on time — reusing the same disk-health data as the System Health tab
- Export as **plain text**, a styled **self-contained HTML** page, or structured
  **JSON** — or copy the text straight to the clipboard
- Fully local: nothing on the system is changed and the report is written only
  to the file you choose — nothing leaves the machine
- **Safe to hand to a stranger.** The report is what you attach to a bug report, so it
  deliberately does not identify your machine: there is no user name and no computer name,
  each adapter's hardware (MAC) address is left out, and its local address is shortened to
  `192.168.x.x`. The network half is kept because that is the part that answers a "no
  internet" question — whether the address is private, static, or a `169.254` self-assigned
  one. A MAC address is permanent, it survives a Windows reinstall, and nobody can take one
  back once it is posted, which is why it is not in there at all

### System Health
- OS / CPU / RAM / storage overview
- SMART data per disk: temperature, wear %, power-on hours, read/write errors
- Colour-coded verdict per drive
- Memory diagnostic that scans the last 30 days of WHEA events for RAM errors. If the event log
  cannot be read, it says the check could not be done rather than reporting no errors
- Schedule the Windows Memory Diagnostic at next boot
- Read-only chkdsk with auto-discovered NTFS/ReFS drives and multi-select. C: is ticked
  to start with, and whatever you tick after that survives a refresh — so a rescan cannot
  quietly point a long disk check at a drive you deselected
- **BIOS & firmware** — BIOS version/date/vendor, motherboard model, boot mode
  (UEFI/Legacy), and Secure Boot status, all read-only. A **Find BIOS update**
  button opens the right manufacturer support page (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, ASRock,
  Dell, HP, Lenovo, …) for the detected board, and **Copy info** grabs the model +
  BIOS version for support searches. SysManager never flashes firmware itself.

### Restore Points
- List every Windows System Restore point — sequence number, date, description,
  and type — newest first
- **Create** a restore point with an optional custom description (enables System
  Restore on the system drive first if it's off). Windows makes at most one a day;
  when it declines, SysManager says so rather than reporting a point that was
  never made — here and on every tab that takes one automatically
- **It says so before turning System Protection back on.** Creating a point turns System
  Protection back on for the Windows drive if it is off, because Windows cannot make one
  otherwise, and protection then keeps some disk space for restore points. The confirmation
  says so here and on Performance Mode, and on the tabs that try a point before their first
  change of a session: Windows Features, Tweaks Hub, Gaming Profile, Privacy & Telemetry,
  Preinstalled Apps, Edge/OneDrive Remover and Defender Tweaks. Those say it only while that
  attempt is still to come and SysManager is running as administrator, since otherwise
  nothing is changed
- **Restore** the PC to a selected point, with a clear confirmation that warns
  Windows will restart and that programs/drivers added since that point are removed
- Admin elevation banner. Listing, creating and restoring all need administrator
  rights, because Windows answers a standard user's request for the list with
  "Access denied". The tab says so, rather than reporting that there are no
  restore points

### Legacy Panels
- One-click launcher for the classic Windows applets that newer releases keep
  hiding: Control Panel, Sound, Power Options, Network Connections, Region,
  System Properties, User Accounts, Device Manager, Computer Management,
  Programs and Features, Mouse, and Date and Time
- **Pure launchers** — each just opens the built-in panel; nothing is modified,
  so no elevation or confirmation is needed
- The applet list is fixed in code, so no typed input ever reaches the launcher

### System Fixes
One-click repairs for common Windows breakages, each with a clear description and
a confirmation before it runs. Split into two groups by whether the fix needs
administrator rights, so it is obvious what you can do without elevating.

**Fix the desktop and taskbar** — no administrator rights needed, and the quickest
things to try first:
- **Restart Windows Explorer** — for a taskbar that has stopped responding, a Start
  menu that will not open, or a desktop with no icons. Every Explorer instance is
  ended individually, so one unkillable process cannot leave you without a shell
- **Rebuild icon & thumbnail cache** — for icons or previews that come up blank,
  wrong, or as a plain white page. Explorer is stopped first, because it holds those
  cache files open — a delete with the shell running clears only the files that are
  *not* the problem. Explorer is brought back even if the delete fails, and Windows
  rebuilds the cache as you browse

**Repair Windows itself** — these change system files, services or settings, so they
need administrator rights:
- **Repair damaged Windows files (SFC)** — runs `SFC /scannow`, which checks every
  protected Windows file against Windows' own known-good copy and replaces the damaged
  ones. Takes 5–15 minutes in the background, with a live percentage, an ETA, and a
  plain-English verdict at the end rather than a raw exit code
- **Repair Windows' own repair source (DISM)** — runs `DISM /RestoreHealth`, which rebuilds
  the store of known-good copies that SFC draws from, downloading replacements through
  Windows Update. Run this first when SFC reports files it could not fix
- **Reset Windows Update** — stop the update services and Windows Installer, rename the
  SoftwareDistribution and catroot2 caches so Windows rebuilds them, and restart the
  services. The confirmation says that it interrupts an installation running elsewhere, and
  that the old folders are kept, a new pair on every reset. It waits for an app install, upgrade
  or uninstall SysManager itself is running, and none starts until it is done. If a cache folder
  is still in use and cannot be renamed, the fix says so instead of asking for a pointless reboot
  — and restarts the services either way
- **Reinstall WinGet** — re-register the App Installer when app installs/uninstalls fail
- **Set up Auto Sign-in** — opens the built-in User Accounts dialog, so Windows
  stores the credential securely and SysManager never handles your password
- Live output, honest success/failure reporting, admin elevation banner
- *Network-stack reset (Winsock / TCP-IP / DNS flush) lives on the Network → Network
  Repair tab, which offers those as individual one-click tools.*
- *Freeing up disk space lives on Cleanup → Quick Cleanup. The two tabs are split by what
  you are trying to achieve rather than by which Windows tool does it: SFC and
  `DISM /RestoreHealth` repair a broken Windows and are here, while
  `DISM /AnalyzeComponentStore` and `/StartComponentCleanup` reclaim space and are there.*

### Tweaks Hub
- **One place for safe, reversible optimizations** that are otherwise spread across
  tabs — review them all in a single list, tick the ones you want, and apply or
  undo in bulk
- **Essential** group — low-risk, per-user tweaks that apply without administrator
- **Advanced** group — higher-impact, machine-wide tweaks behind a caution banner
  (need administrator)
- **Apply Selected / Undo Selected** with a live count of pending changes — nothing
  is written until you click, and each tweak is individually reversible
- SysManager **tries to create a System Restore point** before the first change in a
  session (best-effort — needs administrator and Windows' once-per-24h limit); the
  status line tells you when one was actually created. Every tweak is also
  individually reversible regardless
- Each row shows whether it's currently **Applied** or at the Windows **Default**;
  it's a front-end over the same reversible operations as the Privacy & Telemetry tab

### Boot Analyzer
- Shows how long your PC takes to boot — total, core (main path), and
  desktop ready-up time — across recent boots, read from the Windows
  boot-performance history (Diagnostics-Performance log)
- A trend line tells you whether the last boot was faster or slower than your
  recent average
- Lists the apps, drivers, services, and devices Windows flagged as slowing boot,
  with the delay attributed to each
- **Each row links to the tab that can switch it off** — a slow service opens Services already
  filtered to that service; a slow app or background task opens Startup Manager. Drivers and devices
  get no link, because SysManager cannot disable one and sending you looking would waste your time
- Read-only; reading the log requires administrator (elevation banner shown)
- **A read that fails says so.** "No boots recorded yet" is kept for a history Windows
  returned empty. When the log could not be read, the tab says that instead, and a
  refresh that fails keeps what was already shown

### Task Scheduler
- **Browse every Windows scheduled task** with its state, type, last and next run, and what the task
  is for in Windows' own words — hovering that shows which publisher created it, which is what decides
  the type label
- **Color-coded by type** — Third-party, well-known **Telemetry** (Compatibility
  Appraiser, CEIP, Feedback, Error Reporting), and **System** — so it's obvious
  what's safe to touch
- **Enable / disable** any task; disabling is **fully reversible and never deletes
  the task** — System tasks show an extra warning before you disable them
- Filter by name or path, and optionally hide system tasks to focus on the rest
- **Stoppable** — the task scan can take a while on a machine with a full task tree, so there is a
  Cancel button while it runs, and whatever was already listed stays on screen. Refresh is disabled
  during a scan instead of stacking a second one on top
- **A read that fails says so.** If Windows does not answer, the tab says the tasks could not be
  read rather than that there are none, and a refresh that fails keeps the list you already had
- Changes need administrator and are verified by reading the task's state back
- Overlaps [Startup Manager](#startup-manager) on purpose: that tab lists the third-party tasks among
  these next to the programs that launch at boot, because that is all the shorter answer to "why is my
  PC slow to start" needs. It is the same task in both places, so switching it in one tab applies in the
  other as soon as that tab refreshes — the two lists are not kept in step live

### Windows Update (Windows Update Agent COM API)
- Direct Windows Update Agent COM integration (`Microsoft.Update.Session`) —
  installs everything WUA can offer, including optional drivers and firmware
  that PSWindowsUpdate filters out client-side
- Unified DataGrid for **everything** in one scan — standard, feature
  upgrades, optional drivers, and hidden updates
- Categorized with colored pills: Security, Cumulative, Defender, Driver,
  Servicing, .NET, Feature upgrade, Hidden — click headers to sort
- Per-update checkbox selection with Select all / Deselect all — install
  exactly what you want, skip what you don't
- Live progress per update: `Connecting → Downloading → Installing → ✓ Installed`
  streamed to the console as it happens
- Per-row Status column updated in real time
  (`Pending…` → `Downloading…` → `Installing…` → `Installed` /
  `Installed (reboot required)` / `Failed` / `Not applied`)
- Honest aggregate reporting:
  `Installed X/Y. Failed: Z. Not applied: W.`
- Reboot detection — toast notification if any update requires reboot
- Pending-reboot check, update history (last 30 — via PSWindowsUpdate)
- Admin banner with a one-click "Run as Administrator" relaunch. Installing needs it, and
  without it the tab says so before asking you to approve anything
- PSWindowsUpdate is optional now (used only for the History view); install it
  from a normal, non-administrator SysManager session. The installer validates
  the official PowerShell Gallery endpoint and uses the current-user module directory.
  A **Check now** button confirms on demand whether the module is present, so you
  don't have to run Update History to find out
- **Update timing & deferral** — defer feature updates by N days while security
  patches keep flowing, pause all updates for a bounded window (max 35 days, then
  Windows auto-resumes), or restore defaults. Uses the documented Windows Update
  policy keys and is fully reversible. No "disable updates forever" option by
  design — the strongest action is a bounded pause, so the machine is never left
  permanently unpatched. If Windows will not let it read the current settings, the
  tab says so rather than showing the defaults.

### App Updates (winget)
- Scan for upgradable packages
- Sort by name, ID, version, or source via clickable column headers
- Select all or individual packages, bulk upgrade with per-package status
- **Unticking a package survives a rescan** — including when the rescan finds a newer
  version on offer, since "don't upgrade this one" doesn't stop being true because the
  version changed
- **A check that fails says so.** If winget cannot finish the query — none of its sources
  reachable, for example — the tab says it couldn't check for updates, and why, instead of
  reporting everything up to date
- **Each result says what winget reported.** A download that did not match what winget
  expected is named as that, not as "no update"; an update you cancelled reads "Cancelled",
  and one that needs administrator says so

### Quick Cleanup
Freeing up disk space, and nothing else — the Windows repairs that used to sit here are on
System → System Fixes, where the tab name matches what they do.
- Clear TEMP folders
- Empty the Recycle Bin
- **Component store (WinSxS), reported before it is touched.** WinSxS routinely holds
  several gigabytes of superseded Windows components, and it is where the free editions of
  the mainstream cleaners find their biggest number. "Check component store" runs the
  read-only `DISM /AnalyzeComponentStore` and tells you what Windows itself says is
  reclaimable; only then does "Clean up component store" become clickable, and only behind
  a confirmation that states the cost — after a cleanup, updates already installed can no
  longer be uninstalled. `/ResetBase` is never used, and a test makes it impossible to add
  by accident

### Deep Cleanup
- **Scan-first**: every category is discovered with size + file count
  before a single byte is deleted. You pick what goes.
- **What you untick stays unticked.** Scanning again — including with F5 — keeps your
  choices instead of re-ticking everything, so the tab cannot quietly undo the "untick
  anything you want to keep" it just asked you for. A category that was empty last time
  and has filled up since is the one exception: it was unticked by the scan rather than
  by you, so it takes the default again
- **Says when administrator rights are what's stopping it.** Six of the buckets live in
  the Windows folder — the Windows Update download cache, Delivery Optimization, the
  Installer patch cache, `Windows\Temp`, Prefetch and the blue-screen memory dumps — and
  without administrator they are still scanned and counted but cannot be deleted. They used
  to show as "skipped" with no reason given; the tab now says so at the top, and offers to
  restart elevated
- **System buckets**: NVIDIA / AMD / Intel installer leftovers, Windows
  Update cache, Delivery Optimization cache, Windows Installer patch
  cache, TEMP, Prefetch, crash dumps, old CBS logs, DirectX shader cache,
  Recycle Bin on every drive.
- **The two biggest wins on a machine that has crashed**, both new and both scoped to
  exactly the files they name: the **blue-screen memory dumps** (`MEMORY.DMP` is sized to
  your RAM, so it is routinely gigabytes — never ticked for you, because deleting it ends
  any investigation into the crash) and the **Explorer thumbnail & icon cache**, which
  Windows rebuilds and whose clearing is the standard fix for blank or wrong thumbnails.
  Its folder also holds your recent-files jump lists, so only `thumbcache_*.db` and
  `iconcache_*.db` are counted, and only those are deleted — the same two patterns
  System Fixes uses, from one shared list. Note that Explorer keeps some of those files
  open while it runs, so a clean from here removes the ones it is not using and reports
  the rest as skipped; **System → System Fixes → "Rebuild icon & thumbnail cache"**
  stops Explorer first and gets all of them, which is what you want if the goal is to
  fix blank icons rather than to reclaim space.
- **Gamer buckets** — launcher *caches only*, never game files or logins:
  Steam (appcache, htmlcache, depotcache, shader cache), Epic Games
  Launcher, Battle.net, Riot / League of Legends, GOG Galaxy, EA Desktop.
- **Windows.old** is detected and flagged as irreversible, never selected
  by default.
- Safe by design: never touches browsers, passwords, the registry, active
  drivers, or actual game files. Locked files are skipped, never forced.

### Startup Manager
- Lists the programs that run at Windows boot: the Run and RunOnce registry keys for both your
  account and the whole machine, **including the separate location 64-bit Windows uses for programs
  installed by a 32-bit installer**, plus both Startup folders and scheduled tasks belonging to
  programs you installed. Windows lets only administrators read which scheduled tasks exist, so
  without "Run as administrator" those tasks are left out, and the tab says so
- **Windows' own scheduled tasks are deliberately left out**, so the list stays short enough to read
  and nothing here is something you should not touch. [Task Scheduler](#task-scheduler) is the tab that
  shows every task, Windows' included — a third-party task appears on both, and it is the same task in
  both places. Each task shows its real state, so one that is disabled reads "Disabled (scheduled)" and
  stays that way after a refresh
- **Also reads the "policy" startup list that Task Manager does not show at all** — a favourite hiding
  place for bundled software, since you can switch off everything visible, restart, and it still starts.
  Windows gives an app no way to disable these, so each one is labelled "Set by a system policy —
  managed elsewhere" instead of being offered a switch that would silently do nothing
- Toggle on/off without deleting the original entry (same mechanism as Task Manager) — the disable
  flag is written to the location Windows actually reads for that kind of entry, so a disabled item
  really stays down
- **A Signature column that says whether Windows can confirm the publisher.** The Publisher column
  next to it comes from the file's own version info — a string any program can set to "Microsoft
  Corporation" — so on its own it is a trust badge with nothing behind it. This checks the file's
  certificate instead, using the same chain validation the in-app updater uses, and shows one of
  three things: **Verified** ("Windows can confirm this really comes from Google LLC"), **Unsigned**,
  or **Check failed**. Programs whose command doesn't point at a readable file get no badge at all
  rather than a guess.
  - **Unsigned is grey, not a warning.** Most small utilities are unsigned and so is SysManager
    itself; the tooltip says so in as many words. Amber is reserved for a file that *is* signed and
    whose signature does not hold up — the one case here worth a second look.
  - The verdict is Windows' own, from the same check behind Explorer's **Digital Signatures** tab, so
    it agrees with what Windows tells you elsewhere. It asks for no revocation lookup and answers from
    your PC only, so opening the tab never waits on the network and downloads nothing.
  - **Windows components count as signed too.** Windows signs most of its own programs through a separate
    catalogue file rather than inside the program, and both are read — so `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe` and
    the rest are confirmed rather than listed as unsigned. Anything still marked **Unsigned** after that is
    genuinely unsigned.
- Sort by name, publisher, location, safety, status, signature, or startup impact via clickable column
  headers
- Plain-language description for recognised programs (from the built-in database) instead
  of a raw command line, plus a Safety chip — Windows / Known app / Not recognised — so you
  can tell what an entry is before deciding whether to turn it off
- Shows name, publisher, and enabled/disabled status; the full command path is on hover
- **A Location column** saying where the entry actually lives — which registry Run key and hive, which
  Startup folder, or Task Scheduler. This is the difference between an entry you can switch off yourself,
  one that needs administrator rights, and one a system policy holds in place; long paths shorten from
  the end, with the full value on hover
- **A Startup impact column** — how long Windows measured that program delaying your last start-up, from
  Windows' own boot-performance events rather than an estimate. Sorts by the real delay, so the slowest
  entry comes first. A figure appears only when Windows' report matches the entry exactly, by name or by
  executable file name: a near-match would blame the wrong program, and this is the tab where you act on
  that. Blank means Windows measured nothing, never "0 s". Requires administrator rights, because reading
  those events does — the banner at the top of the tab says so
- Open file location in Explorer

### Windows Features
- Lists all Windows optional features with current state (Enabled/Disabled)
- Toggle enable/disable per feature with confirmation dialog
- Categorized: Virtualization, Networking, Development, Media & Print, Legacy
- Shows reboot-required status after toggling
- **A Windows restore point is attempted before the first toggle of the session**, shared with the
  other tabs that change system settings. This is the tab where it matters most: turning a feature
  back on is a second servicing operation that can itself fail, and unlike removing a Store app,
  a restore point really does cover this kind of change. Mentioned only when Windows actually made
  one, and never on a toggle that failed
- Search/filter across all features
- Requires administrator privileges — to list the features as well as to change them, because
  Windows shows the list only to an administrator. Without it, Scan says so rather than
  reporting an empty list

### Duplicate Finder
- Three-pass scan: group by size, partial-hash pre-filter, then full SHA-256
- Duplicate groups sorted by wasted space (descending)
- Preset folders or custom folder selection
- Configurable minimum file size filter
- **Suggests which copy to keep** — one file per group is badged **Keep**, chosen as the
  oldest (usually the original). The rule is stated on screen rather than applied
  silently, each row shows its date so you can check it, and "Keep this one" moves the
  badge when you know better — a copy that preserved its timestamp, or a cloud-sync
  rewrite, will fool the heuristic
- **Read-only** — "Show in Explorer", "Copy path" and "Keep this one" only. Nothing is
  deleted, moved or renamed; deciding which of five identical photos to remove is done by
  you, in Explorer

### Disk Analyzer
- Space breakdown by top-level folders with drill-down navigation
- Drive usage bar with total/used/free
- Preset paths (fixed drives, user profile, Program Files) or custom browse
- Show in Explorer for each folder
- **Export CSV** saves the breakdown to a file you choose the location for, with both the
  readable size and the raw byte count — so a spreadsheet can sort it, which it cannot do with
  "9.8 GB" and "10 MB" as text. Useful for comparing before and after a cleanup without
  running a minutes-long scan twice from memory
- **Says what it doesn't count** — four Windows system areas (`$Recycle.Bin`,
  `System Volume Information`, `Windows\WinSxS`, `Windows\CSC`) are skipped because they are
  slow or unreadable, and junctions are never followed, since following one would
  double-count or lead outside the folder you asked about. `WinSxS` alone is often several
  GB, so the tab states on screen that its total can be smaller than the free space Windows
  reports, and names the exact folders on hover
- Folders Windows wouldn't let it fully read are marked, so a partial figure never looks
  like a complete one
- A folder it cannot measure at all — one that no longer exists, a link to somewhere else, or
  one Windows will not let it list — is reported as exactly that, not as an empty folder, and is
  not remembered as your last scan of it
- **Remembers your last scan of each folder** and shows what changed — "3.2 GB larger than your
  last scan on 12 Jul" — so a one-off number becomes an answer to "why did my disk fill up?". It is
  always phrased as *since your last scan*, never as live monitoring, because you choose when to
  scan. Stored only on this PC and never carried to another (folder sizes here mean nothing there).
  If the earlier scans cannot be read, the tab says so, and never saves a new scan over them

### Large Files
Answers "what is actually using my space?" by listing the biggest files in one place.
- Scan Downloads, Documents, Desktop, Videos, Pictures, Music, Program Files, or a whole drive
- Configurable minimum size (default 500 MB) and how many to list (default 100)
- **Read-only** — the only actions are "Show" (reveals the file in Explorer) and "Copy path".
  Deletion is disabled by design, even with administrator rights, so a mis-click here can
  never cost you a file. Deleting is a decision to make in Explorer, where you can see what
  else is in the folder
- Windows' own paging files are left out — `pagefile.sys`, `hiberfil.sys` and `swapfile.sys` are
  usually the two biggest files on the system drive, and nothing you can do here affects them.
  [Disk Analyzer](#disk-analyzer) still counts them, which is where to look if you want to know
  how much they take
- Lives beside [Disk Analyzer](#disk-analyzer) and [Duplicate Finder](#duplicate-finder) because
  all three answer the same question and none of them delete anything. It used to sit below Deep
  Cleanup's scan-and-delete list, where it was both hard to find and easy to mistake for part of
  the deletion

### Process Manager
- Lists running Windows processes with PID, memory, threads, status, and when each one started
- Real-time filter by name, description, category, or PID
- Sort by memory, CPU usage, name, category, PID, or start time via clickable column headers
- **Right-click a row** for the same actions the row's buttons offer, or press the Menu key or
  Shift+F10 — the Windows shortcut Task Manager honours. Without it, reaching the buttons on the
  200th process meant arrowing to that row and then pressing Tab through every cell before it. The
  menu item that ends a program is coloured like the button that does, says what it costs, and goes
  through the same confirmation
- **Export CSV** saves the list **as currently filtered** to a file you choose the location for —
  someone who has typed a filter to isolate a suspect gets that list, not all ~470 rows. Both the
  readable and the raw values are included, so a spreadsheet can sort by size and by start time
- **Started column** — when each process began. "Something is eating my CPU" is usually
  answered by *when it appeared*: a process that started three minutes ago is a very
  different suspect from one that has been running since you turned the PC on, and sorting
  by it groups everything that arrived recently. Processes whose start time Windows will
  not reveal — most system processes, unless you run as administrator — show a dash rather
  than a made-up date
- **Built-in description database** — 108 common Windows processes and popular
  applications with plain-language descriptions and categories (System, Browser,
  Development, Communication, Media, Gaming, etc.). The description sits under each
  process name and the category has its own sortable column, so a process you don't
  recognise explains itself without a web search — including the Windows system
  processes whose own description Windows withholds unless SysManager is elevated
- **Safety column** — every process is labelled **Windows**, **Known app** or
  **Not recognised**, with a hover explanation of what that means for ending it.
  Sortable, so everything unrecognised can be grouped together at a glance
- **Signature column** — whether Windows can confirm who made the running program, read
  from the file's own certificate. This is a different question from Safety, and the
  difference is the point: Safety recognises a process by **name**, so a copy of
  `svchost.exe` sitting in a downloads folder inherits the real one's label. The
  certificate belongs to the file. Shows **Verified** ("Windows can confirm this really
  comes from Google LLC" on hover), **Unsigned**, or **Check failed**
  - **Unsigned is grey, not a warning** — most ordinary programs are unsigned, and so is
    SysManager itself. Amber is kept for a file that *is* signed and whose signature does
    not hold up, which is the one case worth a second look
  - Processes whose file Windows will not let SysManager read — most system processes,
    unless you run as administrator — get no badge at all rather than a guess
  - The verdict is Windows' own — the same check behind Explorer's **Digital Signatures** tab. It asks
    for no revocation lookup and answers from your PC only, and it runs just for processes that have
    just appeared, so a tab refreshing every second neither re-checks the same programs nor reaches
    for the network
  - **The list appears first and this column fills in behind it.** Checking a signature takes Windows
    about a fortieth of a second per program, which adds up over everything running, so the process list
    is on screen straight away and the badges arrive over the next couple of seconds rather than the tab
    making you wait for them
  - **Windows components count as signed too** — Windows signs most of its own programs through a
    separate catalogue file rather than inside the program, and both are read, so `svchost.exe`,
    `conhost.exe` and the rest are confirmed rather than listed as unsigned. What is still marked
    **Unsigned** is genuinely unsigned
- Kill process with confirmation dialog, and the warning matches the real cost.
  Processes Windows genuinely cannot survive losing (`winlogon`, `csrss`, `lsass`, …)
  are refused outright. Security and servicing processes (Defender's engine, Windows
  Installer) can be ended, but only after a prompt that says plainly it can switch off
  protection or interrupt an update part-way, and that a restart does not undo that.
  Other Windows components get a warning that a feature may look broken until you
  sign out. Everything else gets the ordinary "unsaved work may be lost" confirm
- **Kill ends that one program**, as Task Manager's End task does. The programs it
  started keep running, so ending Explorer to fix a frozen taskbar does not close
  everything you opened from it. If the program closed while the confirmation was open
  and Windows gave its process ID to another one, that other program is left alone.
  SysManager's own row is refused: close it from its window or the tray instead
- Open file location in Explorer

### Resource History
- **Historical CPU, RAM, GPU usage and temperatures** — the app samples your
  vitals every 10 seconds in the background (including while minimized to the
  tray), so you can investigate what caused a spike yesterday instead of seeing
  only the live moment
- **Scrollable timeline** — pick a range (last hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days,
  30 days); the usage chart (CPU / RAM / GPU %) and a separate temperature chart
  (CPU / GPU °C) redraw to fit, downsampled so even a 30-day view stays smooth
- **Configurable retention** — keep 7, 14, or 30 days of history; older samples
  are pruned automatically. If the setting cannot be read, nothing newer than 30 days
  is pruned until it can be, or until you choose again
- **Export to CSV** — save the visible range for analysis in Excel or elsewhere
- Strictly local: history is stored in your `%LocalAppData%\SysManager` folder
  and nothing ever leaves the machine

### Bandwidth Monitor
- **See your network usage at a glance** — live total download and upload speed
  with a rolling throughput chart (the last ~2 minutes), so you can spot a sudden
  upload (a background sync, an update, something unexpected) the moment it starts
- **Who's using the network** — a per-app list showing which programs are talking,
  how many connections each holds, and the remote ports involved. This works with
  **no administrator rights and no setup** — it reads the same connection tables
  Windows exposes to any user
- **Precise per-app speeds (optional)** — for exact upload/download rates and
  session data totals per app (like Task Manager's Network column), enable precise
  mode; it uses a Windows kernel trace and so **needs administrator**. The tab
  offers it only when you're already running as administrator and falls back to the
  no-admin view automatically if the trace can't start — it never breaks the tab
- **Export CSV** saves the per-app list to a file you choose the location for, with the raw
  bytes-per-second and byte totals beside the readable figures — a file whose only numbers are
  "1.2 MB/s" cannot be sorted or added up. What it says afterwards stays on screen: the
  once-a-second refresh does not write over it
- **Threshold alert** — set a Mbps limit and the tab warns you when total download
  or upload goes over it (handy for catching a runaway background upload); set it to
  0 to turn the alert off
- **Look back over the last hour, day, or week** — pick a range and the chart shows
  the throughput it recorded, with how much you actually downloaded and uploaded over
  that period and the fastest speed you hit. That answers "where did my data cap go?"
  without any account or cloud service. History is recorded while the tab is open and
  kept for 7 days, in a plain file on your own PC
- Strictly local and read-only: SysManager only observes, never throttles or blocks,
  and nothing about your traffic leaves the machine

### File Lock Detector
- **Find what's holding a file** — when you get a "file in use" error, enter a file or
  folder path (or browse to a file) and see which process(es) are using it, via the
  Windows Restart Manager (the same mechanism Explorer's own dialog uses)
- **Folders are checked through the files inside them** — Windows tracks files, not
  folders, so for a folder the tab checks the files in it and its subfolders (up to
  1,000; it says so when a folder holds more) and lists every process holding any of them
- A path that does not exist, or a check Windows could not complete, is reported as
  exactly that — never as "no process is using it"
- Shows process name, PID, type, and start time for each locker
- **Export CSV** saves the list to a file you choose the location for, including the flag that
  marks a process Windows will not let you safely end — the one row nobody should act on
- **End process** — terminate a selected locker (with confirmation) to release
  the file; critical system processes are protected from termination
- **Ends the locker you picked, and no other** — if it closed after the check and
  Windows gave its process ID to another program, that program is left alone, the tab
  says the locker had already closed, and the file is checked again
- Detection works as a standard user; ending a process owned by SYSTEM or
  another user needs administrator rights (surfaced, not crashed)

### Camera/Mic/Location
- Shows which apps recently used your **camera, microphone, or location**, and when
- Reads the Windows access history (CapabilityAccessManager consent store) — covers
  both Store apps and desktop programs
- Devices **in use right now** are flagged and sorted to the top
- If Windows does not let SysManager read a device's history, the tab names that device
  instead of listing the others as if it had been checked, and a Refresh that reads
  nothing at all keeps the previous list on screen
- Read-only: an **Open privacy settings** button hands off to Windows to grant or
  revoke a permission — SysManager never changes capability permissions itself
- **Export CSV** saves the history to a file you choose the location for, so evidence about
  which app used the camera can be sent to whoever helps you with the PC instead of
  photographed off the screen. The file stays on your machine unless you move it

### Settings Watchdog
- **Catch the settings Windows Update silently resets** — feature and quality
  updates often flip telemetry back to Full, re-enable web search, the Widgets
  board, lock-screen ads, and Start-menu suggestions
- **See exactly what is being watched** — the full list of monitored settings, each
  with its value right now in plain language and the reason it is watched, visible
  from the moment you open the tab rather than only after something has changed
- **Save a baseline** of your current preferences with one click; the watchdog
  remembers exactly what each watched setting was. If the baseline cannot be written — a
  full disk, for example — the tab says it was not saved, and why. If a saved baseline
  cannot be read, the tab says so, and saving a new one asks first and keeps the old file
  aside
- **Check now** re-reads the live values and lists any drift in plain language —
  e.g. *"Diagnostic data: was 'Off (Security)', now 'Full'"* — with the category
  and a before/after comparison
- **Export CSV** saves the list of changes before you restore them. Restore overwrites the
  "now" column, so this file is the only record of what Windows changed — which is why the
  button sits to the left of Restore
- **Restore changed** writes the drifted settings back to your baseline values in
  one step (HKLM-backed settings need administrator rights, surfaced not crashed)
- Strictly local: the baseline lives in your `%LocalAppData%\SysManager` folder and
  the watchdog only ever reads or writes a fixed list of well-known registry values

### Operation Lock
- Prevents conflicting concurrent operations across tabs
- Operations grouped by category (Disk, Network, SystemModification, Shell, Install)
- If a conflicting operation is already running, the UI shows which operation
  is blocking and refuses to start the new one
- Integrated into every tab that mutates disk, network, or system state, restarts the Windows
  shell, or installs, upgrades or uninstalls software (Cleanup, Deep Cleanup, Disk Analyzer, Large
  Files, Duplicate Finder, Speed Test, Traceroute, Network Repair, DNS & Hosts, Shortcut Cleaner,
  File Shredder, Browser Cleaner, Performance Mode, Gaming Profile, Environment Variables, System
  Fixes, Windows Features, Windows Update, Restore Points, Context Menu, App Updates, Bulk
  Installer, Uninstaller, Preinstalled Apps, Tweaks Hub, Privacy & Telemetry, Defender Tweaks,
  Edge/OneDrive Remover, Services, and the Dashboard's quick actions)
- **An MSI-based install, upgrade or uninstall started on one of App Updates, Bulk Installer,
  Uninstaller or the Dashboard's Update All Apps while another is running fails with exit code
  1618, because Windows Installer only ever runs one installation at a time.** The four now refuse
  to start a second one instead. Reset Windows Update stops Windows Installer, so it waits for all
  four, and none of them starts while it runs
- **Changing DNS on DNS & Hosts waits for Network Repair, a speed test or a traceroute, and they
  wait for it**, so a DNS change never lands in the middle of a network reset or a measurement.
  Saving or restoring the hosts file waits for nothing: nothing else in SysManager writes that
  file, and each save puts a finished copy in place, so it cannot be left half-written
- **Nothing restarts or services Windows in the middle of a repair.** A feature change, a
  Windows Update install, Reset Windows Update, and creating or restoring a restore point
  each wait their turn behind an SFC or DISM repair, a component-store cleanup, or one another.
  A restore restarts Windows at once, so it can no longer cut off a repair SysManager is running
- **Deep Cleanup and Windows Update take turns with the Windows Update folder.** The "Windows Update cache"
  and "Delivery Optimization cache" categories delete inside it, so a clean with either ticked waits for an
  update install or a Windows Update reset, and they wait for it. The refusal names both ways out, untick
  them or wait, and a clean without them is never held up
- **Gaming Profile takes the lock before it reads your current settings**, not just
  around the changes — it and Performance Mode set the same power plan and the same
  visual-effects switch, so whichever starts second would otherwise write down the
  other one's change as "how you had it" and restore you to that later
- Undoing is never refused. If a game exits while another change is running, the
  optimizations are still reverted — leaving your PC on a gaming power plan because a
  lock was busy would be worse than the clash the lock exists to avoid

### Shortcut Cleaner
- Scans Desktop, Start Menu, Quick Launch, and Recent Items for broken .lnk
  shortcuts whose targets no longer exist
- **"Broken" means the scan proved the target is gone, never that it could not reach it.** A
  shortcut to a file on a drive that is not plugged in, on a network folder that is not
  answering, on a BitLocker volume still locked, or in a folder this user cannot read is
  **left alone and counted**, not listed — because every listed shortcut arrives ticked for
  deletion. The status line says how many were left alone and why, so an empty list on a PC
  with an unplugged drive reads as "nothing confirmed" rather than "your PC is clean"
- Lists results with name, location, and missing target path
- **Export CSV** saves the list before you delete anything, naming both the shortcut and its
  missing target, so the change is reviewable rather than a batch of deletions nobody can audit
- Select all / deselect individual items — and **unticking one survives a rescan**, so
  scanning again cannot quietly put back a shortcut you decided to keep
- Move to Recycle Bin or permanent delete, with confirmation dialog
- COM-based IShellLink resolution for accurate target validation

### Scheduled Maintenance
- **Automate maintenance on a schedule** — register one Windows scheduled task that
  runs SysManager in the background (via its CLI) to clean temporary files or purge
  standby memory, daily or weekly at a time you pick
- See the **last run, next run, and last result** of the task at a glance
- **"Not scheduled" means Windows said so.** If the schedule cannot be read, the page says that
  instead of "No maintenance is scheduled yet", and Save warns that it replaces any schedule
  SysManager has already set
- **Runs on battery too.** Windows will not start a scheduled task on battery unless it is
  told to, so on an unplugged laptop the schedule would silently never fire — it now starts
  regardless, and keeps going if you unplug mid-run. Untick it if you would rather it waited
  for mains power.
- **Optional "only when I'm not using the PC"** condition, off by default
- **The schedule you are about to save is spelled out in words**, conditions included, and
  updates as you change the settings
- **One schedule at a time, said out loud.** Saving replaces the schedule you already had
  rather than adding a second, so the page says so — in the header and again beside the Save
  button — and the confirmation names the time the old one was next due, so you can tell what
  you are about to lose. One task by name is what keeps this feature from needing
  administrator rights and from being able to touch anything else Windows schedules
- **Windows' own count of skipped runs is shown** when it is not zero — the only signal
  Windows gives for a run its conditions blocked
- Update or remove the schedule any time, each with a confirmation
- Runs in your user context (no admin required) and only ever touches its own task
  at `\SysManager\Scheduled Maintenance` — no other scheduled tasks are affected
- Built on the same safe CLI verbs; nothing destructive is automated

### Privacy & Telemetry
- 12 registry-based toggles across 3 categories (Telemetry, UI Declutter, Features)
- **Telemetry**: disable diagnostic data, activity history, advertising ID, feedback prompts
- **UI Declutter**: disable Start suggestions, tips, lock screen tips, Spotlight ads
- **Features**: disable Copilot, Cortana, web search in Start, widgets
- Explicit apply — flip toggles to stage changes, press **Apply** to write to the
  registry, or **Discard** to revert pending changes. A live counter shows how
  many changes are queued, so accidental clicks never modify the system silently.
- Category filter and search
- Requires admin for HKLM-backed toggles
- Fully reversible — re-enable any toggle with one click
- **A Windows restore point is attempted before the first Apply of the session** — the same one
  Tweaks Hub takes, so the protection no longer depends on which tab you reached the toggles
  through. It is attempted after you confirm, so declining costs you nothing, and it is mentioned
  only when one was really created

### File Shredder
- Secure multi-pass file and folder deletion beyond recovery
- Three shred methods: Quick (1 pass, zero fill), Standard (3 passes), Thorough (7 passes)
- Cryptographically random overwrite data (RandomNumberGenerator)
- Add files or entire folders via file picker dialogs
- Per-item progress, and **Cancel stops the queue rather than abandoning a file mid-overwrite.**
  Nothing that has not started is touched; a file whose overwrite has already begun is finished
  and removed, because once the first byte is replaced the original cannot come back — stopping
  there would leave a file at its original name holding nothing while telling you the operation
  was cancelled. The summary says how many items were destroyed before you stopped
- Skips junction points and symbolic links (prevents symlink attacks)
- Confirmation dialog before irreversible shred

### Ping
- **Says WHERE the problem is, not just that there is one.** Targets are tagged by role —
  your gateway, public DNS, game servers, streaming services — and the verdict names the
  layer: "Problem on your local network", "Problem at your ISP or upstream", "It's the game
  server, not you", "Streaming service is slow", or "Multiple layers affected". This is the
  point of the tab: "my internet is bad" is not actionable, "your router is fine, your ISP
  is not" is.
- **Watches several hosts at once**, each with its own live latency, average, jitter and
  loss, and its own colour on the shared chart
- **Five presets for gamers and streamers**, plus your own: type a hostname or IP to add a
  target, and only the ones you added carry a remove button
  - **Global** — Google DNS, Cloudflare, Quad9, google.com
  - **CS2 Europe** — Valve matchmaking relays (Vienna, Luxembourg, Warsaw, EU West/Central/East)
  - **FACEIT Europe** — competitive CS2 servers in DE, NL, UK
  - **PUBG Europe** — the EU matchmaking cloud regions (Frankfurt, Ireland, London)
  - **Streaming** — YouTube, Twitch, Cloudflare, to correlate buffering with the network
- **Your gateway is detected and added automatically**, so the first thing the chart can
  tell you apart is your own network from everything beyond it
- **Live latency chart** with a pickable window (1, 5, 10 or 15 minutes) and a pingable
  interval, default once per second
- Headline numbers across all targets: average ping, worst loss, worst jitter
- Start, Stop and Clear are separate, and the status line confirms what Clear did

### Traceroute
- **Traces every ping target on a loop**, so you can see which hop the latency appears at
  rather than only that the destination is slow — interval 30 s to 10 min, default 60 s
- **Latency per hop, charted**, alongside the hop table (number, address, ms)
- **One-off trace to any host** you type, with its own status line and a Cancel button
- Shares its targets and its start/stop state with the Ping tab, because it is the same
  monitor answering a different question

### Speed Test
- **Two engines, and it explains why they disagree.** Ookla measures raw TCP throughput to
  a nearby server (closest to what you pay your ISP for); the HTTP test measures through
  Cloudflare's CDN (closer to real browsing, usually lower). The tab says this on screen
  rather than leaving you to wonder which number is "wrong".
- **A verdict, not just numbers** — each result says what that speed is actually enough for
  ("Comfortable for HD streaming on one or two devices, and for video calls", "Handles 4K
  streaming and several devices at once") plus one line comparing it with your previous test
  on the same engine, so a slow day is visible as a slow day rather than a number you have
  to interpret
- **Pick the Ookla server** or leave it on Auto (nearest): Bucharest, London, Frankfurt,
  Amsterdam, Paris, New York
- **Separate persistent history per engine**, the last 20 results each — date, download,
  upload, ping and server — clearable on its own, because comparing an HTTP run against an
  Ookla run is not a comparison. A quick test from the Dashboard joins the HTTP history too,
  even while this tab is open. If the saved results cannot be read, the tab says so rather
  than showing none, and a new result is never saved over them
- **A reading it could not take says so.** When no ping gets an answer, which is common on
  networks that block ping, or the server refuses the upload, the card shows "—" and the line
  under it says why. The history records it as not measured, never as a perfect 0 ms ping
- Progress bar with a time-remaining estimate and a Cancel button; the Ookla CLI is
  downloaded on first run
- Only one engine runs at a time, so the two cards can never show conflicting progress

### Network Repair
- **Three fixes, each explained before you press it** — what it does, whether it is safe,
  whether it needs a reboot, and what kind of breakage it is for:
  - **Flush DNS Cache** — clears the local resolver cache for stale entries. Safe, instant,
    no reboot.
  - **Reset Winsock Catalog** — resets the socket API that every networked app uses, for
    damage from broken VPN drivers, malware or corrupted LSP providers. Admin + reboot.
  - **Reset TCP/IP Stack** — rebuilds the TCP/IP registry keys from Windows defaults. The
    last resort, and labelled as one: it discards custom IP configuration, routes and
    adapter settings. Admin + reboot.
- **Admin elevation banner** stating exactly which of the three need elevation and what
  unlocks once you restart elevated
- **A reboot warning appears only after a fix that actually needs one**, rather than
  standing on screen permanently
- Each of the three is confirmed before it runs, and the buttons disable while a repair is
  in flight so two resets cannot overlap

### DNS & Hosts
- **DNS Preset Switching** — one-click DNS change: plain resolvers (Google,
  Cloudflare, Quad9, OpenDNS) plus **ad/malware/family-blocking variants**
  (Cloudflare 1.1.1.2 malware / 1.1.1.3 family, AdGuard DNS ad-blocking + family,
  OpenDNS FamilyShield), each with a description of what it blocks. **IPv6
  resolvers** are configured automatically alongside IPv4. Preset changes and
  reset to automatic (DHCP) are confirmed, then verify the captured adapter and
  DNS state again inside the mutation script. An **Undo** button follows that
  adapter's stable identity and restores its exact prior IPv4 and IPv6
  automatic/static configuration without persisting DHCP-supplied addresses as
  static overrides.
- **Current DNS** — the servers the active adapter uses, or "Automatic (DHCP)" when none
  are set. When Windows cannot report them it says "Unavailable" rather than guessing.
- **Hosts File Editor** — view, add, and remove entries from the Windows
  hosts file with a clean table UI. Add IP + hostname pairs, toggle entries,
  or remove them; the changes are written to the hosts file when you press Save,
  and the tab says so. Backs up hosts file before modifications. It never saves a list
  it could not read from the file: after a failed read, Save asks you to Refresh first
- Requires administrator privileges for both DNS and hosts operations
- Admin elevation banner with one-click restart

### Bulk Installer
- Curated catalog of popular applications grouped by category: Browsers,
  Communication, Media, Development, Utilities, Gaming, Security,
  Office & Productivity, Creativity, Networking & VPN, Runtimes & Frameworks
- Select multiple apps and install all via winget in one batch operation. It asks
  first, naming the apps when there are only a few, and warns that an app that is
  already installed is upgraded instead when a newer version exists, in the same
  words App Updates uses
- **Custom winget search** — search the entire winget repository and add
  any package to your install queue. A search that fails says why, rather than
  "No packages found"
- **Already installed is not a failure** — an app that is already on the PC, with nothing
  newer to install, is marked "Already installed" and counted on its own, not as a failed
  install
- Category filter and text search across the catalog, plus a button that ticks
  every app in the chosen category at once
- Per-package install status tracking with ETA
- GroupedView with visual category headers

### New App Alerts
- Monitors Program Files, AppData\Programs, and registry uninstall keys for
  new application installations
- FileSystemWatcher on install directories + 30-second registry poll cycle
- Shows timestamped install history with app name, publisher, path, and
  detection source
- **Export CSV** saves the history to a file you choose the location for. Worth doing before
  **Clear History**, which erases it — the button sits to the left of it for that reason
- Start/stop monitoring, acknowledge alerts, show all currently installed
  apps, clear history
- Notifies you when a new install is detected, so you find out even when you are
  on another tab or the window is in the notification area

### App Blocker
- Blocks applications from executing using Image File Execution Options (IFEO)
  registry mechanism
- Enter an exe name or browse for a file, confirm, and the app is prevented
  from launching
- Fully reversible — unblock restores normal execution
- A block goes by file name: it stops every program with that name on the PC, for every
  user, and the confirmation says so
- Shows list of currently blocked apps with select/deselect and batch unblock. Your ticks
  survive a refresh, so the Unblock button cannot quietly stop doing anything
- If Windows does not let SysManager read which programs are blocked, the tab says so
  instead of reporting that nothing is, and a failed Refresh keeps the list on screen
- Requires admin privileges for registry modifications, in **both** directions —
  blocking and unblocking write the same protected setting, and each says so
  before asking you to confirm anything
- **Refuses any target whose block could not be undone** — the processes Windows needs
  to start, the permission prompt (`consent.exe`), and SysManager itself. Each refusal
  says which one it is rather than blaming your admin rights
- **Warns about a block it could not lift**, including one written by an older version
  before that refusal existed. Such an entry is marked in the list, raised on the
  Dashboard, and the banner gives the recovery step — including the exact registry
  location, for the case where no permission prompt can appear to grant it
- The confirmation tells you what a block actually looks like: Windows reports that it
  cannot find `SysManager_Blocked.exe`. That missing file **is** the mechanism, not a
  fault, and nothing is deleted

### Preinstalled Apps
Remove preinstalled Windows Store apps you don't use. This tab has no ad or suggestion controls —
those are in **Privacy & Telemetry**, and it used to be called "Debloater & Ads", which promised
them:
- **Scan** all installed Store apps with name, publisher, and a short description
- **Curated "common bloat" preset** pre-selects safe, frequently-removed apps
  (Bing News/Weather, Clipchamp, Solitaire, Xbox apps, consumer Teams, and more)
- **System-critical apps are protected** — the Store, frameworks, and security/shell
  components are denylisted and can never be selected or removed
- **Impact summary + confirmation** before anything is uninstalled
- **Your ticks survive a rescan**, including when an app updates itself in between — apps are
  matched by the identity that stays the same across versions
- **A scan that fails says so**, rather than reporting that there are no Store apps, and a refresh
  that fails keeps the list you already had. One app Windows cannot read does not hide the others
- **Reversible for most apps** — removal is per-user, so an app can be reinstalled from the
  Store, unless Microsoft has retired it, as it has Skype and Mail & Calendar. The confirmation
  names any such app in your selection
- **A Windows restore point is attempted before the first removal**, shared with the other tabs
  that change system settings. Described honestly rather than reassuringly: System Restore does
  **not** bring Store apps back, so reinstalling from the Store stays the real undo and the app
  says exactly that
- Search and per-app descriptions help you decide before removing

### Browser Cleaner
Reclaim space and clear browsing traces, per browser:
- **Auto-detects** Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Firefox, and every Opera channel —
  including **Opera GX**, the gaming build, which is listed as its own row ("Opera GX") beside
  Opera. Beta and Developer are covered too; a channel you don't have simply never appears
- **Every profile, not just the first** — if you keep separate Chrome/Edge/Brave/Vivaldi profiles
  (personal and work, or one per person), each is scanned and named in its own row
  ("Google Chrome — Profile 1"), so you can see which one you're cleaning. Cleaning one
  profile never touches another, and the same holds between Opera channels
- **Firefox profiles are named too, not just numbered.** Firefox stores each profile in a
  folder with a random prefix, so the rows use the readable half — your everyday profile is
  simply "Firefox", and a second one reads "Firefox — dev-edition". Two profiles therefore
  never arrive as two identical "Firefox" rows you cannot tell apart, and a tick on one
  cannot drift onto the other when you rescan
- **Per-category** with size shown: Cache, History, Cookies, Sessions
- **Cookies/sessions are flagged and left unticked** by default — cleaning them
  signs you out, so it's always an explicit choice; cache and history are pre-selected
- **Your ticks survive a rescan, in both directions** — unticking cache or history is not
  put back, and ticking cookies or sessions is not taken away. If you have opted into
  signing out, the summary says so instead of repeating the reassurance that you have not
- **Firefox gets cache, cookies and sessions — but not history, on purpose.** Firefox
  keeps history and your bookmarks in the same file (`places.sqlite`), so clearing
  "history" would delete your bookmarks with it. Rather than do that quietly, the tab
  simply doesn't offer History for Firefox. Its cookies and sessions target only their
  own named files — never saved logins, keys or bookmarks
- **Confirmation with an impact summary** before anything is deleted
- Per-user (no admin); locked files (browser open) are skipped, not forced, and
  symlinks/junctions are never followed. When a browser held every file, the result says
  nothing was removed and suggests closing the browser, rather than "Browser data cleaned"

### Edge/OneDrive Remover
Get Microsoft Edge and OneDrive out of your way — reversibly:
- **OneDrive: full removal for your account** — stops the client, runs the official
  uninstaller, and clears its File Explorer sidebar entry. No admin needed. Files
  already synced to this PC stay on disk; cloud-only files simply aren't downloaded
- **Edge: disable & de-integrate, never uninstall** — Windows relies on Edge (WebView2)
  and reinstalls it if forced out, so instead this turns off its background mode and
  startup boost (via the documented Group-Policy keys) and disables its automatic-update
  scheduled tasks, so Edge stops running on its own. You can still open it normally.
  Without those tasks it no longer updates itself in the background, so its security
  fixes can arrive late until you restore it
- **A Restore button for each** — reinstall OneDrive and re-pin its sidebar entry, or
  clear the Edge policies and re-enable its update tasks — so nothing here is one-way.
  The OneDrive entry comes back only once its setup has succeeded; a failed reinstall
  is reported as failed, just as a failed removal is
- **Honest about the default browser** — Windows hash-protects the default-browser
  choice, so no app can switch it for you; the tab opens Windows' default-apps settings
  and guides you instead of pretending to change it
- Every action confirms first with a plain-language impact summary; disabling Edge needs
  administrator (the tab explains why and what it unlocks), removing OneDrive does not
- **A Windows restore point is attempted before the first change of the session** — shared with
  the other tabs that change system settings, so at most one is made no matter how many tabs you
  use. It is mentioned only when one was really created: System Restore is switched off on many
  PCs and Windows allows roughly one point a day, so silence means "no snapshot", never a promise

### Defender Tweaks
Manage Microsoft Defender without digging through Windows Security:
- **Status at a glance** — real-time protection, cloud protection (MAPS), PUA
  protection, and Controlled Folder Access
- **Toggle PUA protection and Controlled Folder Access** (ransomware protection). Turning
  Controlled Folder Access on first says which apps it will stop from saving into your
  folders, and where in Windows Security to allow one
- **Scan exclusions** — add or remove folders Defender should skip (handy for
  big game libraries); paths are validated and additions never replace your
  existing exclusions. Windows shows the list only to an administrator, so
  without elevation the card says the exclusions are hidden rather than showing
  an empty list
- **Honest about Tamper Protection** — if it's on, Windows can silently ignore
  changes, so the tab detects it, warns you, and only reports a change as done
  after reading it back and confirming Windows actually applied it
- Changes need administrator and are confirmed first; lowering a protection is
  always an explicit, reversible choice
- **A Windows restore point is attempted before the first change of the session**, shared with the
  other tabs that change system settings. All four changes run through one path, so none of them can
  quietly skip it, and it is mentioned only when Windows really made one — never on a change that
  was rejected

### Notification Blocker
Mute the apps that nag you with pop-up notifications — update reminders, trial
offers, "rate us" prompts:
- **Lists every app that has shown a notification**, most recently active first,
  with how many notifications it sent recently so the noisy ones stand out
- **Mute per app** with a switch — it flips the same per-app setting as Windows
  Settings > Notifications, so nothing is hooked or hacked, and Windows itself
  honors it
- **Master switch** to silence everything at once (with a clear warning that it
  also mutes calendar and reminder alerts)
- **Pending-changes flow** — flips stay local until you press Apply, with a
  confirmation and a Discard to back out
- Fully reversible (flip the switch back), per-user, no administrator needed

### Battery Health
- Charge %, health %, wear level, cycle count, chemistry
- Design vs full-charge capacity via WMI
- Estimated runtime display
- Gracefully shows "No battery detected" on desktops
- If Windows does not answer the battery query, the tab says the battery could not be
  read rather than that there is none, and a failed Refresh keeps the last reading on
  screen, saying it is from then
- Health and wear need administrator rights (Windows only reports capacity to an
  elevated process). Without it they read "Not available" and the page explains
  why, instead of showing a number that isn't a measurement.

### Uninstaller
- Lists all installed applications via winget with size from registry. If winget cannot
  list them, the tab says so instead of reporting 0 applications
- Filter by name or package ID
- Sort by name, size, or publisher via clickable column headers
- Select/deselect all, batch uninstall with confirmation dialog. Ticks survive a rescan, and
  applications Windows reports without a package id — most of the older ones — are matched by
  name too, so they are not treated as one entry
- Local app support — uninstalls apps not in winget via registry UninstallString
- **"Removed" means removed** — an app is taken off the list only once Windows stops listing it,
  whether SysManager runs its uninstaller directly or through winget. Some uninstallers hand over
  to a second copy of themselves and return straight away; those apps stay on the list, marked as
  still installed, until the uninstaller finishes and you scan again
- Runs uninstall actions only from an unelevated SysManager session; each package requests its own UAC elevation when required

### Gaming Profile 🔬
- **One-click "game mode"** — apply a bundle of reversible optimizations together,
  then restore them automatically when the game exits (or with a single Stop)
- **Optionally target a running game** — its CPU priority is raised to High and it's
  pinned to the performance cores, and its exit is what triggers the automatic revert, even
  when it closes while game mode is still starting
- **Changes the game you picked, and no other** — if it closed after the list was read and
  Windows gave its process ID to another program, Start changes nothing and says the game had
  already closed, and neither raising, restoring nor waiting for the game ever reaches that program
- **System-wide optimizations** — Ultimate Performance power plan, reduced visual
  effects, finest (~0.5 ms) timer resolution, freeing standby memory, pausing Windows
  Search indexing, and silencing notifications — each ticked individually
- **Fully reversible & snapshot-based** — the original state (power plan, visual
  effects, indexing, notifications) is captured before any change and restored exactly;
  SysManager also tries a System Restore point first (best-effort, needs administrator)
- **Your own changes win** — if you switch notifications back on yourself while a profile is
  running (from Privacy & Security → Notifications, which is the same switch), the restore leaves
  your choice alone instead of silencing them again when the game exits. If you mute them yourself
  on the Notifications tab, they stay muted, and if SysManager cannot tell whether you did, it
  switches them back on. Likewise, if the fast timer was already on from the Timer Resolution tab,
  game mode leaves it on when it ends
- **Crash-safe** — the session is recorded on disk, so if SysManager closes mid-game the
  system-wide changes are offered for restore on next launch. If SysManager cannot read that
  record, Start changes nothing and says so, rather than writing over it
- **Honest about the restore** — every setting is put back even if one of them fails, and the
  tab names any setting it could not restore, instead of saying everything is back
- **Honest about admin** — freeing standby memory and pausing indexing need
  administrator; without it they're clearly skipped, not silently failed
- 🔬 Preview — fully reversible today; closing background apps and saved per-game
  profiles are planned for a later update

### Timer Resolution
- **Lower input latency for games** — requests the finest Windows timer
  resolution (≈0.5 ms) instead of the ~15.6 ms default, via the ntdll
  `NtSetTimerResolution` API
- **Live current/finest/default readout** — always re-queries the *effective*
  resolution (Windows 11 may stop honoring a request while the window is
  minimized), so the number shown is the real one
- **One-click enable / restore** — fully reversible; the request is released
  when you restore it or simply close the app. No admin required
- **Honest about other programs** — Windows runs the timer at the fastest rate any
  program asks for, so a game, a browser playing video or a chat app can keep it
  fast after SysManager lets go. The tab says so and shows the value, instead of
  claiming the timer is back to the Windows default
- **Power-cost warning** — a finer timer wakes the CPU more often, increasing
  power draw and battery drain on laptops

### Display Profiles
- **Quick-switch resolution + refresh rate** — pick a mode (e.g. 165 Hz for
  gaming, 60 Hz for work) from the list of everything your display supports,
  using only the Windows display APIs (no NVIDIA/AMD tool conflict)
- **Safe by design** — applies for the session, so a reboot reverts; on top of
  that a **15-second auto-revert** restores the previous mode unless you confirm
  "Keep", so a bad mode can never strand you on a blank screen
- **Per-display** — choose which monitor to configure; shows the current mode
- Validates each mode (CDS_TEST) before applying; no admin required

### CPU Core Affinity
- **Pin a process to specific CPU cores** — pick a running process and choose
  which logical CPUs it may run on, then Apply (or Restore the original)
- **Filter the process list** by name or ID, so finding your game isn't a scroll
  through hundreds of `svchost` entries — the same filter the Services, Task
  Scheduler and Windows Features lists have
- **See what's already pinned** — a process running on a subset of cores shows it
  in the list ("chrome (1234) — 4 of 16 cores"), so you can tell at a glance what
  you've already tuned instead of selecting each one to find out
- **Hybrid-CPU aware** — on Intel 12th-gen+ CPUs, P-cores and E-cores are
  detected and labelled (via `GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx`), with one-click
  **P-cores** / **All cores** presets
- **Safe and temporary** — affinity is per-running-process and reverts when the
  process exits; no admin for your own processes (changing another user's
  process is surfaced as needing admin, not a crash)
- **Changes the process you picked, and no other** — if it closed after the list was
  read and Windows gave its process ID to another program, Apply and Restore leave that
  program alone, say the process had already closed, and refresh the list
- An empty selection is rejected — Windows treats an empty mask as "let the OS
  decide", so the app never silently does the opposite of what you picked

### Standby List Cleaner
- **Frees cached standby memory** — the built-in equivalent of ISLC, to reduce
  stutter when RAM runs low in games
- **Live stats** — total RAM, available, and memory load %, refreshed every 2s
- **Purge on demand** or **auto-purge** when available RAM drops below a
  threshold you set with a slider
- **Safe and non-destructive** — the standby list is clean, disk-backed file
  cache, so clearing it loses nothing; Windows reloads from disk on next use
- Reading stats needs no admin; purging requires administrator (it enables the
  same privilege RAMMap and ISLC use) and reports cleanly if not elevated
- The auto-purge switch and its threshold are remembered between sessions, so
  arming it once is enough: after a restart it starts watching as soon as
  SysManager opens (as administrator), without the tab being opened first. If they
  cannot be read when SysManager starts, a change still applies but is not saved over
  them, and the status line says so

### Performance Mode
- **Per-tweak Apply buttons** — each setting is independent
- **Power Plan**: Balanced / High Performance / Ultimate Performance — Ultimate is switched on in any
  Windows display language, and reported as failed rather than set when Windows does not provide it
- **Visual Effects**: reduce animations via P/Invoke (instant, no logout)
- **Game Mode**: enable/disable via registry
- **Xbox Game Bar**: disable overlay and Game DVR via registry
- **NVIDIA GPU**: force max performance with auto-detected GPU subkey (reboot required)
- **Processor State**: force CPU min state to 100%
- **Overlays info**: manual instructions for Discord, Steam, NVIDIA GFE, EA App
- **OriginalSnapshot**: captures the exact system state before the first change,
  persists it locally, and reloads it when the tab opens so Restore All remains
  available after an app restart; persisted fields are validated before use and the
  confirmation shows when the baseline was captured
- **It will not record your settings while a game profile is running** — those are the
  profile's power plan and visual effects, not yours, and saving them as your baseline
  would restore you to them later. It asks you to stop the profile first. A baseline
  saved *before* the profile started is still used normally
- **It never records over a baseline it cannot read** — after an earlier change, the settings
  on the PC are the tweaks, and recording them as your original would make Restore All put them
  back. If the saved baseline cannot be read, the change is stopped and nothing is recorded. A
  damaged one is set aside once, you are told, and the next Apply records your current settings
  as the new original
- Confirmation dialog before every change
- **Restore point creation**: create a Windows System Restore point before
  making changes (requires admin)
- **RAM working set trim**: free physical RAM by trimming all process working
  sets — same as RAMMap's "Empty Working Set" (useful before launching a game)
- **Hibernation toggle**: enable/disable hibernation to free disk space
  (deletes hiberfil.sys when disabled, which also turns off Fast Startup and hybrid sleep).
  On a PC that does not support hibernation it
  says the change failed instead of reporting it done

### Services
- Lists all Windows services with current status and startup type
- **Gaming recommendations**: services tagged as "safe to disable", "advanced",
  or "keep enabled" — hover a row's description to read why, in plain language
  instead of Microsoft's own wording
- Filter by status (Running/Stopped), safety level (Safe/Caution/Critical),
  gaming recommendation (Safe to disable / Keep enabled / Advanced), or free-text
  search — each chip shows how many services it matches, so you know before pressing it
- Mark any row with the flag button to keep it findable while you keep filtering or
  searching. "Clear marks" removes them all, including any a filter is hiding
- **Says what else breaks before you break it** — when other services need the one you
  are turning off, they are named in the confirmation by their real names, so the choice
  is "my printer will stop working" rather than "this may affect system functionality".
  The names are on the safety pill's tooltip too, which needs no admin rights to read
- Start, stop, disable, or enable services with confirmation dialogs
- **Enable puts back what was there** — the startup type a service had before SysManager disabled
  it, remembered across restarts, "Automatic (Delayed Start)" included. For a service disabled some
  other way there is nothing to put back, so Enable sets it to Manual, and its confirmation says so.
  If SysManager cannot read or update that record, Disable and Enable leave the service alone and
  say so, rather than losing how the other services were set
- **Never claims a change it did not make** — Enable acts only on a disabled service and Disable only
  on one that is not, and each says so and leaves the service alone otherwise. Stop says when Windows
  will not stop a service rather than reporting that it did
- **Right-click a row** — or press the Menu key or Shift+F10 — for Start, Stop, Disable, Enable and
  Mark, the same five actions as the row's buttons and through the same commands, so every
  confirmation still applies. services.msc has worked this way for twenty years; four buttons per
  row previously meant Tabbing through every cell of every preceding row to reach one
- Requires admin for all mutations

### Drivers
- Sortable DataGrid table of all installed system drivers
- Columns: Device Name, Manufacturer, Version, Date, Signature — click headers to sort
- **Signature** — whether Windows reports the driver as digitally signed. Manufacturer
  is a name the driver package supplies about itself, so it proves nothing; this column
  comes from Windows. It says "Signed", not "Safe" — a signature identifies the
  publisher, and Windows will load a signed driver from anyone with a valid
  certificate. Blank means Windows reported nothing, which is not the same as unsigned
- **Hide built-in Windows drivers** — tick the filter to leave only the drivers your
  hardware maker installed (graphics, audio, network, …), which is usually what you
  care about when checking whether something needs updating. The count shows both
  totals, so nothing looks like it vanished
- Data parsed from `Get-CimInstance Win32_PnPSignedDriver`
- A scan that fails says so instead of reporting 0 drivers, and keeps the previous list.
  If Windows reports an error part-way through, the drivers it did list are shown with a
  note that some may be missing

### Dashboard
- One-line OS / CPU / RAM / disk summary
- Live uptime counter
- **Every finding links to its fix** — alerts and health recommendations show a "Fix this" link to the
  tab that can act on them: disk and memory to System Health, a pending restart to Windows Update, waiting
  updates to App Updates, critical events to System Logs, low disk space to Deep Cleanup, high memory to
  Process Manager. Findings with nothing wrong show no link, and neither do the two pieces of advice no
  tab here can carry out — restarting, and replacing a worn battery
- **System Alerts** — disk health, app updates, memory errors in the last 30 days, critical events in the
  last 7 days, a pending reboot, and any app block that cannot be undone normally. They are checked when
  SysManager starts, again when you press "Scan system", and after Update All Apps. A check that could not
  run says so in amber rather than reading as good news
- **Real-time vitals** — CPU, RAM, and GPU usage refreshed at 300 ms while
  the tab is visible (polling pauses automatically when it isn't), with live
  indicator dots.
- **Recent Activity** — what SysManager actually changed on this PC, with timestamps:
  cleanups, deletes, uninstalls, privacy and DNS changes, restore points, shredded
  files. Counts and sizes only — never file names, since the log is plain text on
  your own disk. Opening a tab isn't an action, so it isn't listed, and neither is a speed
  test, which goes into the Speed Test history instead. It does note when SysManager closed
  unexpectedly the previous time. A cleanup run from the command line or from Scheduled
  Maintenance appears here too, even while SysManager is open. If the history cannot be read
  for a moment, a new action waits and is written once it can be, rather than replacing it.
- **Quick Tune-Up** — one-click wizard that cleans temp files, permanently
  empties the Recycle Bin, scans for broken shortcuts, checks disk SMART
  health, flags high uptime (14+ days) and high RAM usage (85%+). Displays
  a summary card with freed space, warnings, and links to relevant tabs.
  A check that could not run is named on the card ("Not checked this time:
  the disks") rather than counted as fine, so "All good" means every check
  ran and found nothing. The confirmation says that the Recycle Bin's contents
  cannot be recovered; nothing else it does is destructive. No admin required.
- **Quick Actions** — Run Quick Cleanup, Update All Apps, Check Windows Updates and Run Speed
  Test run in place with a progress bar, and the result says whether it worked: an app update
  that fails ends as "Failed" with winget's reason, not "Done". Check Windows Updates asks
  Windows Update what is waiting and says how many updates it found, or that Windows is up to
  date. It installs nothing: the link under the result opens the Windows Update tab, where you
  choose what to install. Run Speed Test records its result in the Speed Test tab's history, and
  does not start while another speed test, a traceroute or a network repair is running. In the same
  way, Run Quick Cleanup does not start while another cleanup or disk scan is running, and Update
  All Apps does not start while App Updates, Bulk Installer or Uninstaller is at work or Reset
  Windows Update is running
- **Health Score** — overall system health gauge (0–100) combining disk
  SMART, free space on the system drive, RAM usage, uptime, and battery
  wear. Free space counts for a quarter of it, because a full drive is the
  commonest reason a PC feels slow and the one thing on that list you can
  fix today — so a machine that is out of room cannot score green, and the
  recommendation says how many GB are left and points at Deep Cleanup.
  Color-coded ring (green / amber / red) with up to 3 actionable
  recommendations. Auto-computes on load and refreshes with "Scan system".
  A battery counts only when its wear was actually read. Windows gives
  that only to administrators, so without elevation the battery is left
  out rather than scored as new.
- **System Tray** — background health monitoring (60s polling), CPU/RAM tooltip,
  Windows notifications when RAM > 90%, uptime > 14 days, or disk health degrades.
- **A tray menu that is worth opening** — because minimize-to-tray is the default, the tray
  is where the app spends most of its life. Right-clicking it shows the current CPU, memory
  and uptime on one line, refreshed as you open it, then three shortcuts: **What's using my
  PC**, **Free up space** and **Volume mixer**. Every item either opens a tab or reads a
  number — nothing that changes your system is one click away from here, because a
  confirmation dialog is not visible from the tray. Three is a deliberate ceiling.
- **Closing is your choice** — the first time you close the window, SysManager asks
  whether it should keep running in the notification area or close completely, and
  remembers the answer. If you pick the notification area, it tells you where the
  window went so it doesn't look like it vanished. Right-click the tray icon to
  reopen or exit at any time.
- **Nothing is cut off by closing** — if SysManager is still in the middle of something
  that changes your system (a repair, a Windows feature or update being installed, a
  clean-up), closing the window, **Exit** in the tray, **Run as administrator** and
  installing an update all say what is still running and ask before they go ahead,
  because closing stops it part-way
- **Progress on the taskbar button** — a long job keeps reporting while the window is
  minimised. The SysManager button on the taskbar fills up as an SFC scan, a bulk
  install or a deep cleanup progresses, and shows a moving bar for the tabs that know
  they are working but not how far along. It follows the tab you have open, and it
  goes blank when the job finishes rather than sitting at an empty bar

### About
- **Version, build, license and source** in one place, with the update controls beside them
  rather than buried in a settings page
- **What's new, pulled live from GitHub** — every release with its version, date and full
  changelog, and a badge marking the one you are running, so you can see what you skipped
  without leaving the app
- **Go back to the previous version** — the build you updated from is kept, and this button
  restores it. It appears only when that build is actually on disk, and refuses with a
  reason rather than half-doing it when the swap would not be safe.
- **Export or copy a full system report**, and a separate "Copy environment info" for
  pasting into a bug report
- **Save diagnostics bundle** writes one `.zip` with everything a bug report needs: the
  system report, your environment info, and the three most recent daily log files. It
  replaces four manual steps, the last two of which were finding a hidden `AppData` folder
  and working out which day's log covered the problem. **Nothing is sent anywhere** — you
  choose where the file goes and whether to attach it, and a `README.txt` inside names every
  file and says what was deliberately left out. Your network adapters' hardware addresses are
  not included and the host part of each local IP is masked, because a hardware address is
  permanent and cannot be withdrawn once it is posted in public. Your Windows user name is
  already stripped from every log line before it reaches disk. An oversized log is cut to its
  most recent activity so the zip stays small enough to attach, and says so at the top.
- **Report a problem** and **Ask a question** open the right GitHub page directly; **View
  license** and **What's new** open the licence and the changelog
- **The startup version check is a checkbox here** — "Check GitHub for a new version when
  SysManager starts" — and switching it off does not disable the **Check for updates**
  button, which still works on demand. Switched off, it stays off even if the setting cannot
  be read for a moment. What that check does and does not send is described
  under [Privacy](#privacy).

### Updates (for SysManager itself)
- Auto-check on startup against the GitHub Releases API, plus a manual
  "Check for updates" button in the About tab.
- Discreet banner in the main window when a newer version is available.
- Background download of the new build with a progress bar. If the
  download is blocked, a "Manual download" button opens GitHub in the
  browser.
- SHA256 hash verification before install — the downloaded build is checked
  against the published `.sha256`, so a damaged or truncated download is blocked.
  Both files come from the same release, so this catches a corrupted download rather
  than a substituted release asset — see [Verifying the download](#verifying-the-download)
  for the stronger check, the build attestation, which you run yourself.
- The build is also inspected for an Authenticode signature, and the check fails
  closed if a signature is present but cannot be read. SysManager ships unsigned
  today and no publisher is pinned yet, so a signature is not currently an integrity
  gate; the publisher-and-certificate-chain check is written and switches on with a
  one-line change the day a signing certificate exists.
- One-click "Install" replaces the running executable in-place and
  restarts automatically (no manual file copying needed). It asks first, because it
  closes SysManager, and names anything still running that closing would cut off.
- **"Go back to the previous version"** — the build being replaced is kept, so an
  update that installs cleanly but turns out to be broken is not a dead end. The
  button appears in the About tab only when a retained copy exists, asks for
  confirmation, and notes that whatever the newer version fixed will come back too.
  One generation is kept, so it never accumulates copies of the app.
- Full release-note history pulled live from GitHub — the notes for the newest
  version appear under the update check, the last ten releases below it, and each
  card links to its release on GitHub. If GitHub cannot be reached, the section
  says so instead of going blank.
- **"Report a problem"** opens the GitHub bug-report form with your SysManager
  version and administrator state already filled in — the two fields reports most
  often miss — and **"Ask a question"** opens Discussions for anything that is not
  a bug. Both are in the About tab; a browser tab opens only when you press them.

### Profile Export / Import
- Export your SysManager settings to a single portable JSON file and import them on
  another PC: **theme and appearance, dark-mode schedule, gaming profiles, volume
  presets, close-button behaviour, standby-memory preference, update-check preference,
  app-icon fetching preference, and speed-test history**
- **Selective export** (tick which sections to include) and **selective import**
  (confirm what a profile contains before anything is overwritten). Your ticks survive a
  refresh, so a section you excluded cannot quietly reappear in the export. An import says
  how many of the profile's sections could not be applied, rather than only how many were
- **Exports what is saved now** — each ticked section is read from disk at the moment you
  export, and the list is re-read whenever you come back to the tab, so a theme, preset or
  speed test you changed since the tab first opened goes into the file
- **Version-aware** — refuses profiles created by a newer, incompatible build
- **What it deliberately leaves out** — anything that describes *this* PC rather than
  your choices: the undo baselines behind Performance Mode and Environment Variables,
  the Settings Watchdog's record of this machine's registry, the service-startup ledger,
  and the local activity log. Carrying those to another PC would restore it to settings
  it was never on, or report differences that are only "a different computer"
- Only SysManager's own config is ever touched (never system settings), so an
  import is fully reversible — just import a different profile

### CLI Interface
- **Automate the safe actions from scripts, Task Scheduler, or deployment tools** —
  SysManager accepts command-line flags and runs headless (no window), writing its
  output to the launching console
- Commands: `--health` (read-only health score), `--cleanup` (temp-file cleanup,
  never follows junctions), `--purge-standby` (purge the standby list), plus `--version`,
  `--help`, and `--list`. `--trim-ram` still works as an alias for `--purge-standby`,
  so an existing scheduled task keeps running; new scripts should use the current name,
  which says which of the two memory operations it is
- `--json` emits machine-readable output; `--silent` suppresses chatter for
  scripting; conventional **exit codes** (0 success · 1 error · 2 usage) let a script
  branch on the result
- Only read-only or non-destructive actions are exposed on the CLI — anything that
  changes the system irreversibly stays in the GUI behind a confirmation dialog
- **The two actions that change something record themselves in the app's history**, marked
  as having come from the command line. So a scheduled cleanup that ran while you were
  away is visible next time you open SysManager, instead of leaving no trace. `--health`
  deliberately records nothing: it changes nothing, and a script polling it would push
  the real entries out of a history that only keeps the last 60
- The in-app **CLI Interface** tab is a reference: it lists every command with a
  one-click copy button. Example: `SysManager.exe --cleanup --silent`

## Install

### Via winget (recommended)

SysManager is published to the [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/)
community repository. Install or update with a single command:

```powershell
winget install laurentiu021.SysManager
```

Updates are delivered automatically with each release — run `winget upgrade`
to stay on the latest version.

### Direct download

Grab `SysManager-v<version>.exe` (the `<version>` shown on the latest release) from the
[latest release](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/releases/latest)
and double-click it. The executable is self-contained — no installer, no .NET
runtime required.

> **About the download counter.** The badge above counts release-asset downloads, not
> people. Most of that number is machinery: SysManager's own in-app updater fetches the
> exe, winget installs fetch it, and Microsoft's manifest validation fetches it for every
> submitted version. Across all releases the exe has been fetched roughly 88 times for
> every checksum file — and a human verifying a download takes both. Treat the badge as
> traffic, not as an install base.

### Why portable, and why there is no installer

The only build is a portable `.exe`. That is a decision, not an omission, and it has a cost
worth stating alongside the benefit.

**What you get.** Nothing is written outside `%LocalAppData%\SysManager` unless you ask for
it. There is no service, no scheduled task you did not create, no uninstaller to trust, and
no registry footprint to clean up — delete the exe and the app is gone. You can run it from
a USB stick on a machine you are fixing for someone else, which is a large part of what this
tool is for.

**What it costs.** A portable exe lives in a user-writable location, so another process
running under your account could replace it on disk. That is inherent to any portable app
and has nothing to do with SysManager's update flow. If you run SysManager elevated, run a
build you got from the Releases page and verified. A machine-scope build under
`Program Files`, which is not user-writable, is on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) alongside code
signing — the two belong together, because an installed build people trust should be a
signed one.

**No Microsoft Store build.** The Store sandbox forbids most of what this app does: reading
other processes' working sets, writing the hosts file, changing services and scheduled
tasks, purging the standby list. A Store version would be a different, much smaller app
wearing the same name.

**Unsigned, for now.** Windows shows a warning on first launch and some antivirus engines
flag an unknown publisher. Both are explained below, along with how to check the download
yourself: [First launch](#first-launch-windows-will-warn-you) ·
[Verifying the download](#verifying-the-download) ·
[If your antivirus flags the download](#if-your-antivirus-flags-the-download) ·
[Code signing](#code-signing).

### Verifying the download

Each release ships a matching `SysManager-v<version>.exe.sha256`. Verify before running
(replace `<version>` with the version you downloaded):

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\SysManager-v<version>.exe -Algorithm SHA256
# Compare the output to the contents of SysManager-v<version>.exe.sha256.
```

That check confirms the file downloaded intact. To also confirm **where the file came
from**, each release carries a GitHub build attestation — a signed record, kept in a
public transparency log outside this repository, tying that exact binary to the commit
and workflow that produced it. With the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```powershell
gh attestation verify .\SysManager-v<version>.exe --repo laurentiu021/SystemManager
```

This is the stronger of the two checks. The `.sha256` file is generated in the same job
and published onto the same release as the binary it describes, so both come from one
source — enough to catch a corrupted download, but not a substituted release asset. The
attestation is signed by GitHub's own infrastructure at build time and logged publicly, so
it also records *which* commit and workflow produced the file, and that record cannot be
rewritten after the fact. Each release also ships
`SysManager-v<version>.sbom.json`, a CycloneDX inventory of every NuGet package resolved
for that build — useful for checking the dependency set against a vulnerability feed.

### First launch: Windows will warn you

The first time you run it, Windows shows a blue box titled **"Windows protected your
PC"**. This is expected, and it is worth knowing what it does and does not mean.

It means Windows does not recognise the publisher. Code-signing certificates cost money
and require a registered identity, and SysManager is a free one-person project without
one yet, so every build is "unknown publisher" to Windows regardless of what it contains.
It is **not** a virus warning — Windows has not found anything wrong with the file.

The dialog only offers a **Don't run** button. To continue:

1. Verify the SHA256 first, using the command above. Do this before anything else — it is
   what makes the next step safe rather than blind.
2. Click **More info** — a small link in the dialog, easy to miss.
3. The file name and publisher appear, along with a **Run anyway** button. Click it.

Windows remembers the choice, so this only happens once per downloaded version.

If you would rather avoid the warning altogether, install through winget instead:

```powershell
winget install laurentiu021.SysManager
```

winget fetches and validates the package outside the browser download path, so the
first-launch prompt does not appear.

> Only click through this warning for a file you downloaded from
> [the official releases page](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/releases/latest)
> **and** whose hash you verified. The same dialog protects you from genuinely malicious
> files, so it is worth reading rather than reflexively dismissing.

### If your antivirus flags the download

Windows Defender or another antivirus may flag or quarantine the `.exe` — sometimes days
after it ran fine, because these tools also score a file on how widely it has been seen
before. This is the second-most-likely thing to happen after the SmartScreen box above, so
it is worth explaining rather than leaving you to guess.

**Why it happens.** Two reasons, and neither is about what the code does:

- **The shape of the file.** SysManager ships as one large executable that carries
  everything it needs inside it, compressed, and unpacks itself into a temporary folder when
  you launch it. That is a legitimate way to ship a portable app with no installer — and it
  is also what some malware does to hide, so a scanner that judges structure rather than
  behaviour treats it as suspicious. Add an unknown publisher and no signature, and a
  heuristic engine has every reason to be cautious.
- **What the app genuinely does.** It deletes files, changes registry settings and stops
  processes. That *is* the job of a maintenance tool, and it is also a fair description of
  something you would not want running unasked.

**How to check, instead of guessing.** Take the SHA-256 from the
[release page](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/releases/latest) and open

```
https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/<paste-the-sha256-here>
```

VirusTotal addresses files by hash, so if that exact build has been scanned this shows the
report — including which engines flagged it and which did not. If nobody has submitted that
build yet the page will say so, and you can upload it there yourself.

Then read the [Verifying the download](#verifying-the-download) section above and run the
build attestation. That is the check that actually settles the question: it proves the file
you hold is the output of a public workflow, built from a public commit in this repository.

> **Be honest about what a scan proves.** A couple of hits out of ~70 engines on an unsigned,
> compressed, self-extracting build is the ordinary pattern for this kind of file — it is not
> by itself evidence of a problem. Equally, a completely clean sheet is not proof that a file
> is safe; plenty of malware is clean on the day it is released. The attestation is stronger
> than either, because it ties the binary to source you can read.

**If it has already been quarantined**, restore it or add an exclusion **only after** the
SHA-256 matches and `gh attestation verify` succeeds. If either check fails, delete the file
and download it again from the releases page — do not add an exclusion for a file you have
not verified.

### Code signing

Releases are currently **unsigned**, which is why the warning above appears. The intention is
to sign them through the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) — a programme that
provides free code-signing certificates to open-source projects, with the signing performed
by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) — and an application there is the plan for this
project. It has not happened yet: the Foundation asks for a level of public visibility
(stars, external write-ups, independent references) that a three-month-old project does not
have, which is a fair bar for a certificate issued in their name. Until a certificate is
actually in place, this section says so plainly rather than implying one exists.

Until a certificate is in place, the two checks above — the published SHA-256 and the
GitHub build-provenance attestation — are what establish that a download is the genuine,
unmodified build. The attestation is the stronger of the two, and it will remain useful
after signing arrives: it records *which commit and workflow* produced a given binary,
which a signature alone does not.

The update path is already written for signing, but not yet armed. The publisher it
compares against is a single constant that is deliberately **empty** until a certificate
exists, so today a signed build is accepted on the strength of the SHA-256 check alone; a
signature that is present but unreadable is still refused. On the day signing is switched
on, filling in that one constant turns on the publisher match and the certificate-chain
validation together — the point of writing them now is that the check cannot quietly become
a formality later. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#security-model) for the detail.

### Code signing policy

> **Not yet in effect.** This policy is written in advance of any certificate, because the
> [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) programme the project hopes to sign through
> requires the roles and approval process below to be documented and public before an
> application is considered. Nothing here describes a signing arrangement that exists today —
> releases are unsigned, and the SHA-256 plus build attestation above are what verify a
> download. The provider attribution that belongs in this section will be added on the day a
> certificate is actually issued, and not a day earlier.

**Team roles.** SysManager is maintained by a single developer, so all three roles below are
held by the same person. That is stated plainly rather than dressed up as a team, because it
is the honest description of who can change the code and who approves a release.

- **Authors** (may commit to the repository): [laurentiu021](https://github.com/laurentiu021)
- **Reviewers** (must review any change proposed by a non-committer):
  [laurentiu021](https://github.com/laurentiu021)
- **Approvers** (decide whether a given release may be signed):
  [laurentiu021](https://github.com/laurentiu021)

Every change reaches `main` through a pull request whose build-and-test check has passed;
`main` is protected, requires branches to be up to date before merging, and force-pushes and
deletions are disabled. Releases are built only by GitHub Actions from this public repository
— no binary is ever built or uploaded from a developer machine — and each carries a SHA-256
checksum, a CycloneDX SBOM, and a GitHub build-provenance attestation recording the exact
commit and workflow that produced it. That attestation is the load-bearing guarantee here:
because a single maintainer necessarily holds administrative rights, the meaningful assurance
is not "the rules cannot be bypassed" but "every published binary is verifiably the output of
a public workflow run against a public commit", which anyone can check with
`gh attestation verify`.

**Privacy policy.** This program will not transfer any information to other networked systems
unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it. The full
policy — including a table of every file the app writes on your own machine, and the four
situations in which it uses the network at all — is in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#privacy).

Third-party components are listed in the SBOM published with every release. The network
features that contact anything outside your machine do so only against a destination you
choose (ping, traceroute and speed-test targets; app installs through winget), plus one
optional daily version check against the GitHub Releases API that can be switched off.

## Uninstalling

SysManager is a single portable executable. There is no installer, nothing is copied into
`Program Files`, and no system-wide registry keys are created for the app itself.

To remove it completely:

1. **Delete the executable** — `SysManager-vX.Y.Z.exe`, wherever you saved it. That is the
   whole program.
2. **Delete its settings and logs** (optional, a few hundred kilobytes):
   - `%LocalAppData%\SysManager`
   - `%AppData%\SysManager`
3. **Remove the scheduled task, if you created one.** Only applies if you used **Scheduled
   Maintenance**: open that tab and remove the schedule, and the app unregisters the task for
   you. It is the only thing SysManager registers with Windows, and only ever when you
   explicitly ask for it.

If you installed through winget, `winget uninstall laurentiu021.SysManager` covers step 1.

Changes you asked SysManager to make to Windows — privacy toggles, context-menu entries,
services, tweaks — are Windows settings rather than part of the app, so they stay as you set
them. Every tab that changes something offers the reverse action, so undo anything you want
reverted **before** deleting the executable.

## Build from source

Prerequisites: Windows 10 or newer and the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager.git
cd SystemManager
dotnet run --project SysManager/SysManager/SysManager.csproj
```

### Produce a single-file exe

From the repo root:

```powershell
.\publish.ps1
```

Or manually:

```powershell
dotnet publish SysManager/SysManager/SysManager.csproj `
  -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true `
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true `
  -o publish
```

The resulting `SysManager.exe` lands in `publish/` and runs standalone on any
Windows 10 / 11 x64 machine.

## First-time flow

1. Launch the app — it opens on the Dashboard.
2. Go to Network and press Start — live ping begins.
3. For anything in Windows Update, System Fixes (SFC/DISM), or system-wide App
   updates, click the yellow "Run as Administrator" banner when it appears.
   The app relaunches elevated.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Found something broken? Missing a feature you'd love to have?

Two threads worth reading before you post — linked directly, because Discussions is sorted
by recency and every release posts an announcement there, so these sit a long way down the
list:

- 📌 [**Start here**](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/discussions/2346) — what
  this project is, what it will not become, and where to put which kind of post.
- 🗺️ [**Roadmap**](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/discussions/2345) — what is
  being worked on and what has been decided against, so you can tell whether your idea is
  already answered.

- 🐛 **Bugs** — [open an issue](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)
  using the bug report template.
- 💡 **Features** — [open an issue](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)
  using the feature request template, or post in
  [Discussions › Ideas](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/discussions/categories/ideas)
  if it's still a rough idea rather than a concrete request.
- 💬 **Questions and how-to's** — use
  [Discussions › Q&A](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/discussions/categories/q-a)
  instead of issues for anything open-ended.
- 🔒 **Security vulnerabilities** — please report privately via the
  [Security tab](https://github.com/laurentiu021/SystemManager/security/advisories/new).
  See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full policy.

The **About** tab inside the app has a "Copy environment info" helper that
dumps your SysManager version, Windows build, CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, display,
and elevation state in a format ready to paste into a bug report.

## Tech stack

- .NET 10 (WPF, C# 14)
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for MVVM plumbing
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for IoC
- HandyControl (HandyControls) for the base theme and controls
- LiveCharts2 for the real-time latency chart

## Privacy

SysManager runs entirely on your machine. It does not phone home, does not
collect telemetry, and does not require an account. Network features only
contact the hosts you explicitly configure (ping targets, speed-test servers,
Windows Update / winget endpoints).

## Support

SysManager is free and open source, built by one person in their spare time.
If it saved you a reinstall or a clean-up headache, you can back its development:

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-laurentiu021-EA4AAA?logo=githubsponsors&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/sponsors/laurentiu021)

Sponsorships go toward a code-signing certificate — which makes Windows show the
publisher's name instead of "unknown publisher", and reduces the SmartScreen warning
as the signed builds accumulate reputation — plus the build pipeline and time to fix
bugs and finish the tools that are still half-built. The app stays free either way.
