/// drops the banner from one of these tabs (as had happened to six of them), the corresponding case fails
/// by name.
/// <para>Which variant is in view depends on the host: the CI runner is elevated, a developer's box
/// usually is not, and the app inherits the test process's integrity level because <c>AppFixture</c>
/// launches it with <c>UseShellExecute = false</c>.</para>
