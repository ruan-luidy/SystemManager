    /// Posted rather than marshalled synchronously. This is reached from 39 call sites, most of them
    /// the last line of an async scan on a background thread, and a caller has nothing to gain by
    /// waiting for a notification to have been raised. It was the most widely reached of the ten
    /// blocking marshals in #2152.
    /// <para>The no-window early return is kept deliberately rather than folded into
    /// <see cref="UiThread.Post"/>. Post runs inline when there is no dispatcher, which is right for a
    /// property assignment and wrong here: there is nothing to show a toast in, and running the body
    /// would construct a <see cref="DispatcherTimer"/> on a thread whose dispatcher never pumps. No
    /// window means no toast, which is what this did before.</para>
