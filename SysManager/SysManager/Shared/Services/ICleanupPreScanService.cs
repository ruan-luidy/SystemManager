/// A seam, and it exists for a reason beyond tidiness. This work used to sit inline in
/// <c>CleanupViewModel.PreScanAsync</c>, which the constructor fires and forgets — so building the view-model
/// started a recursive walk of both temp folders and every per-SID Recycle Bin folder. In the unit suite that
/// happened 30 times in one file, and one test asserted that the walk finished within fifteen seconds, which
/// is a claim about the machine rather than about the code. It failed on a normally-used desktop while passing
/// on CI, where the profile is nearly empty.
/// <para>Behind an interface, a test states what the numbers are and never touches a disk.</para>
