/// means the in-session revert and the crash-recovery revert share ONE path: recovery simply
/// rebuilds the machine-wide tweaks from the persisted snapshot and calls
/// <see cref="RevertAsync"/>. Modelling every step behind this seam also lets the ordering,
/// admin-degradation, failure-isolation, and revert-in-reverse logic in
