        // returned at 334 ms, no exception, no output. And on CI the opposite end of the same hole — Stop
        // failing to interrupt a running pipeline, which then finishes normally 30 seconds later.
        //
        // Either way the caller was handed an empty result set and no indication that anything was
        // cancelled. Every consumer is written around OperationCanceledException — 31 view-models have a
        // cancel branch and the services deliberately let it propagate — so a silent empty return does not
        // merely lose the signal, it looks like a successful run that found nothing. Which for a query is

        // finished is a true and complete answer worth preserving, whereas an empty collection from a script
