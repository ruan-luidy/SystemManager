/// <summary>
/// The directories Deep Cleanup's scan is built from. Injected so a test can point the scan at a tree
/// it created itself, instead of at whatever happens to be on the machine running the suite (#2176).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <see cref="DeepCleanupService"/> asked the machine directly — <c>Environment.GetFolderPath</c> for
/// five special folders and <c>DriveInfo.GetDrives()</c> for the launcher probes — with no parameter to
/// redirect any of it. So its LOGIC was unassertable: a test could not say "a category over a folder
/// holding 3 files of 10 bytes reports 3 files and 30 bytes", because it could not create that folder
/// anywhere the scan would look. What was left were shapes that hold on any machine (the name is
/// non-empty, the size is non-negative), which pass for reasons nobody chose — and pass differently on a
/// fresh CI runner, where those caches are nearly all empty, than on a real workstation.
/// <para>Deliberately the ROOTS and not a filesystem abstraction. <c>CleanAsync</c> already takes the
/// paths it operates on, which is why its tests build real temp trees today and are the strongest in the
/// file. This gives <c>ScanAsync</c> the same property with the smallest possible seam: everything below
/// a root is still the real <see cref="System.IO.Directory"/>, so junction skipping, permission failures
/// and size aggregation are exercised for real rather than against a fake.</para>
