/// <summary>
/// The one implementation of <see cref="ISessionRestorePoint"/>. Registered as a singleton so
/// "once per session" means once for the whole app, not once per tab: two tabs each taking their own
/// snapshot would burn the 24-hour rate limit on a duplicate and leave the second user action
/// unprotected for no benefit.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Takes the single capability it needs — "create a point, tell me whether it happened" — rather
/// than <see cref="RestorePointService"/> itself, which is sealed and therefore unmockable. That
/// would have forced either an interface across every existing consumer or unsealing production
/// code for the benefit of a test; a delegate keeps the seam where it belongs and lets these tests
/// run with no proxy framework at all.
