/// Aggregates data from multiple services into a single 0–100 health score.
/// Components weighted:
///   - Disk health (SMART): 25%
///   - Free space on the system drive: 25%
///   - RAM usage: 20%
///   - Uptime: 15%
///   - Battery wear: 15% (only when a battery's health was read; redistributed otherwise, to 30/25/25/20)

/// Free space was not a component until it had to be. Without it the score could read "Excellent" on a
/// machine that was out of room — SMART healthy, RAM under 60% and a recent reboot were enough — which is the
/// commonest real cause of "my laptop got slow" and the state that breaks Windows Update and app installs.
/// A flagship number that is confidently wrong costs more trust than a missing feature.
/// <para>Adding it moves every existing score: a machine that read 92 may now read less with nothing
/// changed on it. That is the point, and the changelog says so rather than letting it look like a
