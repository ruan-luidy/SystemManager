/// <summary>
/// Lets a view model send the user to another tab, so a tab that diagnoses something can offer the
/// tab that fixes it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Before this, the one view model that did it reached through
/// <c>Application.Current.MainWindow.DataContext</c> and cast it to the shell — a service locator that
/// cannot be tested and only works while a window happens to be up. Copying that to a second and third
/// caller is what #1504 warned against, so the seam came first: the callers depend on this interface and
/// a test substitutes it.
/// <para>Deliberately just an id and an optional filter. A richer contract — "navigate and select row
/// X", "navigate and start a scan" — would make every destination's internals part of this interface.
/// The filter is the exception because it is the difference between arriving at a list of 200 services
/// and arriving at the one service the user was told about, and every destination that can honour it
/// already has the property.</para>
/// </remarks>

    /// dead link, which is a defect to fix, not a reason to crash the app under the user's click.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="navId">The nav id, e.g. <c>nav-system-health</c>.</param>
    /// <param name="filter">

    /// implements <see cref="IFilterable"/>. Ignored otherwise, so a caller may always pass it.

/// A tab whose list can be narrowed by text, so navigation can arrive pre-filtered.

/// Late-bound on purpose. The shell builds the tab view models, and those view models take this
/// service — so a constructor dependency on the shell would be a cycle. <see cref="Bind"/> is called
/// by the shell's constructor, which is before any tab can be clicked.
/// <para>An unbound service logs and does nothing rather than throwing. It is unbound only in a test
/// or a designer, where a swallowed navigation is right and an exception would fail unrelated tests.</para>
