    // ArchitectureTests.StaticPathMethods_AcceptARedirect reflects over SysManager.Services and INVOKES every
    // parameterless static method that returns a string, to see whether it resolves a path under the user's
    // profile with no override. As statics these two were called for real, walking the entire temp tree and
    // every per-SID Recycle Bin folder, and that guard sat there for twenty minutes. They return a size LABEL
    // rather than a path, so it was not even reporting anything — pure collateral cost.
    // Both walks go through SafeFileWalk rather than SearchOption.AllDirectories, which was wrong three ways
    // at once. AllDirectories throws UnauthorizedAccessException out of MoveNext(), and the catch has to sit
    // outside the foreach — so one protected subfolder ended the whole walk and the headline reported
    // whatever had been summed up to that point, silently low. It also follows junctions, so bytes living
    // outside the tree counted as freeable; in the Recycle Bin that is the common case, because deleting a
    // junction puts a reparse point IN the bin. And the temp figure has to exclude what the sweep refuses to
    // delete, or it promises space Clean TEMP will correctly leave alone.
