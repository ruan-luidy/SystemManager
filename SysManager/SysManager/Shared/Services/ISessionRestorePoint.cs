/// One System Restore point per app session, shared by every tab that changes system state, so the
/// safety net does not depend on which door the user came through.
/// <para>Before this existed, <c>TweaksHubService</c> owned a private copy of the logic and was the
/// only place that had it: flipping a privacy toggle through Tweaks Hub took a snapshot, while the
/// identical registry write from the Privacy tab, or removing Edge, took none. An unpredictable
/// guarantee is the worst kind — it is the reason the user feels able to press the button at all.</para>
/// <para><b>Deliberately best-effort.</b> System Restore is off by default on much of consumer
/// Windows, needs administrator, and Windows rate-limits creation to roughly one point per 24 hours.
/// A "no" is therefore normal and must never be presented as protection that exists. Callers report
/// the snapshot ONLY when one was actually created.</para>
