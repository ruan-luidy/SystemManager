/// Extracted because the chain policy was written out twice — in
/// <c>SpeedTestService.VerifyOoklaSignature</c> for a third-party download and in
/// <c>UpdateService.VerifyAuthenticode</c> for our own installer — and the two copies are the kind that
/// drift silently: a weakened revocation mode in one of them changes a security posture while every test
/// stays green. The Startup Manager needs the same reading for a third purpose, which would have made it
/// three.
/// <para><b>What is deliberately NOT shared: the policy that decides what the answer MEANS.</b> The two
/// existing callers disagree on the most important case — an unsigned file is fatal for the Ookla binary
/// and expected for our own — and they disagree on whether to throw or return false. Folding those
/// together is how a fail-closed gate quietly becomes permissive, so each caller keeps its own decision
/// and this type answers only the mechanical question.</para>
/// <para><b>Why two calls rather than one.</b> Both callers check the certificate's subject BEFORE
/// building the chain, and building a chain with online revocation makes a network request. A single
/// "inspect" call would therefore have to build the chain first, adding a revocation fetch on exactly the
/// path where the subject already failed. Keeping the steps separate preserves both the ordering and the
