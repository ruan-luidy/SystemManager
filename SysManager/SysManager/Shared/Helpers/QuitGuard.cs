/// cancellation by ending the child process, so a DISM repair, a Windows feature being turned on or a Windows Update
/// install was cut off part-way, or left running with nothing watching it, and no exit route said so (#2499). The
/// repairs, installs, clean-ups, scans and tweaks that take an <see cref="OperationLockService"/> lock are registered

/// takes no lock is not seen here.
