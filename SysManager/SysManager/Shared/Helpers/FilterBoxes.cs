/// <remarks>
/// A tab states which of its text boxes is the filter by what that box binds, and there was no need to
/// invent a marker: 12 of the tabs already bind one of four property names. Keying on the existing
/// binding means no view had to change and no view model gained a member — focusing a control is a View
/// concern, and routing it through a view model would have put UI manipulation where the MVVM rules say
/// it must not go.
/// <para><b>The name list was measured, not assumed.</b> Three names looked like the whole set until a
/// scan of every <c>TextBox</c> whose accessible name mentions filtering or search turned up a twelfth
/// tab — Task Scheduler binds plain <c>Filter</c>. A shortcut that works on eleven tabs and silently not
/// the twelfth is worse than none, because the user learns it is unreliable, so
/// <c>ArchitectureTests.EveryFilterBox_BindsANameCtrlFRecognises</c> holds the list against the views.</para>
