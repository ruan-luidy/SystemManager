/// <summary>
/// Turns a file path into the three-state answer an informational column shows: who signed it, or why
/// nobody can say.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <b>The verdict comes from Windows, not from a chain we build ourselves.</b> This used to read the
/// signer certificate and build an <c>X509Chain</c> offline, and that does not work: measured over the 82
/// distinct process images on a stock Windows 11 machine it verified <b>1</b> and reported "Check failed"
/// for <b>47</b>, including Explorer, svchost and Outlook. An offline chain build still demands a
/// revocation answer it has no cached CRL for, and an intermediate certificate it cannot fetch. See
/// <see cref="WindowsTrust"/> for the measurement and the flags. <c>WinVerifyTrust</c> over the same files
/// returns 46 trusted and 1 genuine failure.
/// <para>The certificate is still read, but only for the publisher's <em>name</em> — never for the
/// verdict. That ordering matters: a name is cosmetic, so failing to read one costs a phrase in a tooltip,
/// whereas the verdict decides what colour the user sees.</para>
/// <para>This is deliberately NOT part of <see cref="Authenticode"/>. That type answers only the
/// mechanical managed questions and holds no policy, because the two fail-closed gates disagree with each
/// other on the most important case: an unsigned file is fatal for the third-party Ookla binary and
/// expected for our own build. Folding a meaning into it is how one of those gates would quietly become
/// permissive.</para>
/// <para>So this type carries one specific policy: <b>the informational one</b>, used by columns that
/// describe many files and admit no code. Its rules are the ones a list needs and a gate must not have —
/// unsigned is ordinary rather than fatal, nothing reaches the network, and every answer comes with a
/// sentence a non-technical reader can act on. A gate that adopted these would stop being a gate.</para>
/// <para>Shared between the Startup Manager and the Process Manager because both ask the identical
/// question of an executable on disk, and because the alternative — the same paragraph of copy written
/// twice — is the kind of duplication that drifts into two tabs describing one verdict differently.</para>
