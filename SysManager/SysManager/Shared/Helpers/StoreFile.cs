/// The read half of a load-modify-save, for a file that holds everything a store has saved.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Most stores read their whole file, change one item and write the whole file back. They used to turn a read that
/// failed into the same value as "nothing saved yet", so the write that followed replaced everything the file held
/// with that one change (#2521). <see cref="AtomicFile"/> makes the write safe. This makes the read safe to write over:
/// <see cref="ReadText"/> tells a missing file from one that could not be read, and <see cref="SetAside"/> keeps a
/// file that does not parse, rather than destroying it.
