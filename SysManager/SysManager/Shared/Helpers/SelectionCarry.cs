/// Nine tabs rebuild a bound collection from a fresh scan. The six this started with used to re-derive the
/// tick state from a default — so a refresh discarded what the user had chosen. In four of them the fresh
/// rows arrive pre-selected, which meant a refresh did not merely forget the choice but REVERSED it, and the
/// next action then deleted, upgraded or exported exactly what had been excluded. <c>RefreshOnF5</c> reaches
/// all six, so pressing F5 was enough (#2300, #2301, #2304).
/// <para>Each of those six was fixed with its own copy of this logic first, deliberately, so the fixes could
/// ship with tests rather than waiting on a refactor. This is that refactor — one body, no behaviour change —
/// and three tabs have been keyed through it since.</para>
