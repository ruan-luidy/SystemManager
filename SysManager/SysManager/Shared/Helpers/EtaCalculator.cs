/// <summary>
/// Calculates estimated time remaining (ETA) for any operation that reports progress as a percentage
/// (0–100), from a smoothed estimate of how fast progress is actually moving.
/// <para>
/// Usage: call <see cref="Reset"/> when the operation starts, then call <see cref="Update"/> each time
/// progress changes. Read <see cref="Remaining"/> or <see cref="RemainingText"/> for the current
/// estimate — both are evaluated when read, so they keep counting down between progress reports rather
/// than holding whatever the last report produced.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This used to extrapolate from the average since the start (<c>elapsed * 100 / percent</c>), computed
/// only when a caller reported progress. Three consequences, all measured against the old formula:
/// callers derive percent by integer division, so during one long step the SAME percent arrives
/// repeatedly — and the estimate GREW with elapsed time, climbing from "~1 min" to "~37 min" while the
/// bar never moved; between reports the text froze on a number that was already stale; and a slow first
/// step displayed "~1.6 h" moments before the real answer turned out to be 90 s.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Thread safety: every public member is serialized on an internal lock, so callers may report progress
/// from whatever thread it reaches them on. That is not a convenience — <c>CleanupViewModel</c> feeds this
/// from <c>PowerShellRunner.LineReceived</c>, raised on the <c>OutputDataReceived</c> and
/// <c>ErrorDataReceived</c> threadpool threads with nothing marshalling in between, and the previous
/// "callers must be single-threaded" contract was simply not being met.
