/// <b>Why this exists alongside <see cref="Authenticode"/> rather than inside it.</b> Those are two
/// different mechanisms answering two different questions, and conflating them is what produced the defect
/// this type fixes. <see cref="Authenticode"/> reads a certificate and builds a chain with the managed
/// <c>X509Chain</c>, which the two fail-closed gates need because they compare a specific publisher's
/// subject before deciding. This asks the operating system for a verdict, which is what an informational
/// column needs.
/// <para><b>The measurement that made the case.</b> Over the 82 distinct process images running on a stock
/// Windows 11 machine, the managed approach verified <b>1</b> and reported "Check failed" for <b>47</b> —
/// including Explorer, svchost and Outlook. <c>WinVerifyTrust</c> over the same files: <b>46 trusted, 1
/// genuine failure</b> (an expired certificate). The managed path cannot do better without the network,
/// because <c>RevocationMode.Offline</c> still demands a revocation answer it has no cached CRL for
/// (<c>RevocationStatusUnknown</c> on 46 of 48) and a chain it cannot complete locally
/// (<c>PartialChain</c> on 29). Loosening the flags far enough to pass would mean accepting any
/// certificate authority, which is not verification.</para>
/// <para><b>No network request.</b> <c>WTD_REVOKE_NONE</c> asks for no revocation check, and
/// <c>WTD_CACHE_ONLY_URL_RETRIEVAL</c> tells the trust provider to answer from this machine's caches
/// rather than fetching anything. That is the "local only" guarantee the offline chain policy was reached
/// for and does not actually deliver — here it is a documented, supported mode rather than a side effect
/// of a revocation setting.</para>
/// <para><b>Catalog signatures are read too, and they are not a detail.</b> <c>WTD_CHOICE_FILE</c> sees only
/// the signature embedded in a file, and Windows signs most of its own components through a <c>.cat</c>
/// catalogue instead — 35 of those 82 images carry no embedded signature, and 12 of the 35 are verified
/// through a catalogue, including <c>powershell.exe</c>, <c>cmd.exe</c>, <c>conhost.exe</c> and the search
/// host. Reporting those as unsigned understated them on the one tab whose question is "is this Windows?".
/// The remaining 23 are genuinely unsigned third-party programs.</para>
