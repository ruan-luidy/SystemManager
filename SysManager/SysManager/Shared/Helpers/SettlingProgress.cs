/// <summary>
/// A progress reporter that delivers reports while an operation runs and drops every one that arrives after
/// it has ended, so whatever the caller writes afterwards is the value that stays on screen.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><see cref="Progress{T}"/> delivers through <see cref="SynchronizationContext.Post"/>. On the UI
/// thread that context is the Dispatcher, and a post and an await continuation queued at the same priority
/// run in the order they were queued — so the shipped app happens to see the caller's final write last. That
/// is an ordering guarantee nothing states and no test can see: one <c>ConfigureAwait(false)</c>, one
/// <c>Task.Run</c> or one detached continuation revokes it, and a unit test has no context at all, which
/// makes both writes unordered threadpool work.</para>
/// <para>It has already gone wrong once. In <c>FileShredderViewModel</c> the service's last report — raised
/// from a <c>ConfigureAwait(false)</c> continuation — drained after the continuation that recorded the
/// outcome, so an erased file was left labelled <c>"Shredding pass 2/3..."</c> forever and a required check
/// went flaky on CI (#2391). Ten more callbacks across eight further view models write a property their own
/// post-await code also writes as its terminal value (#2392); the worst of them replaces an instruction the
/// user has to act on, <c>"Download complete. Click Install to restart with the new version."</c>, with a
/// byte count.</para>
/// <para>That first fix was a latch hand-rolled in place, deliberately, so it could ship with a test. This is
/// the shared version: one body, eleven sites across nine view models. Passing the operation in rather than
/// exposing the latch is what makes the correct use the only use — a caller cannot report past the end
/// without also having asked for the end.</para>
/// </remarks>
/// <typeparam name="T">The progress value the operation reports.</typeparam>
