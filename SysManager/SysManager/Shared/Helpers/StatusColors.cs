/// <summary>
/// Canonical status-colour KEYS shared by the models and view-models that expose a
/// <c>*ColorHex</c> property (disk health, temperature, health score, tune-up results,
/// cleanup categories, etc.).
/// <para>These used to be dark-calibrated hex literals (<c>#22C55E</c> and friends). A
/// <c>const</c> is baked in at compile time, so <see cref="ThemeService"/> could never
/// recompute them — and on the light presets they rendered as pale text on near-white cards,
/// below the AA 4.5:1 floor, on exactly the tabs that answer "is my PC OK?".
/// <see cref="ThemeService"/> already recomputes the equivalent semantic brushes per
/// mode, so these now NAME that brush rather than duplicating a colour:
/// <see cref="HexToBrushConverter"/> resolves a key against the live theme resources and still
/// falls back to parsing a literal hex, so any other caller keeps working.</para>
/// <para>The producers' property names are deliberately unchanged, so none of the XAML binding
/// paths had to move.</para>
