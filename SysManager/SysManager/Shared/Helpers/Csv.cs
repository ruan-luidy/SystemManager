/// Builds CSV a spreadsheet will read back correctly, including fields that contain the separator.

/// <remarks>
/// <see cref="ResourceHistoryService.ToCsv"/> came first and writes its fields raw, which is safe
/// there because every one of them is a number or a fixed-format timestamp. The exports that followed carry
/// app names, setting descriptions and folder paths — text a user chose or Windows chose, and
/// <c>C:\Users\me\Music\Grieg, Peer Gynt</c> is an ordinary folder name that silently becomes two columns
/// without quoting. So the escaping lives here once rather than being re-derived per tab.
/// <para>RFC 4180: a field is quoted when it contains a comma, a quote, CR or LF, and an embedded quote is
/// doubled. Nothing else is altered — no trimming, no separator substitution — because a lossy export of a
/// path is worse than a quoted one.</para>
