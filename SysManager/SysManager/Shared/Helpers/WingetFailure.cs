/// <para>Three tabs run winget — App Updates, Uninstaller, and Bulk Installer — and they had drifted
/// into three different levels of care. Uninstaller translated its exit codes and caught the
/// missing-winget case; App Updates caught the missing case and reused Uninstaller's message; Bulk
/// Installer did neither, writing <c>Failed (exit 1618)</c> and raw OS exception text into the row.

/// <para>Everything lives here so a fourth caller cannot reintroduce the drift. The
/// install and uninstall maps are kept SEPARATE: winget reports different codes for the two
/// operations, so sharing one map would produce confidently wrong sentences. winget's own codes are
/// written as the named constants on <see cref="WingetExitCodes"/>, never as numbers (#2462).</para>
