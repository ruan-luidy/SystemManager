/// <param name="Detail">What that allows, in recognisable terms rather than in Mbps.</param>
/// <param name="ColorKey">
/// A semantic key from <see cref="StatusColors"/>, resolved against the live theme by
/// HexToBrushConverter — never a hex literal, or the light presets would render it below the AA

/// <param name="Comparison">
/// One sentence against the previous run on the same engine, or empty when there is no history.

/// <remarks>
/// An immutable record rather than an <c>ObservableObject</c> like <see cref="HealthDiagnostic"/>: a
/// speed test produces one verdict per completed run, so the view model swaps the whole value through
/// an <c>[ObservableProperty]</c>. HealthDiagnostic is mutable because ping updates it in place
/// several times a second and a single binding has to follow it.
