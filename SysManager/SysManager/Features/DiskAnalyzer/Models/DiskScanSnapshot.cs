/// One remembered Disk Analyzer scan, keyed by the root that was scanned. Persisted so the tab can
/// answer the question a one-off number cannot — "what changed since last time?" — with a delta line.
/// <para>Deliberately small: the measured total plus the top folders by size, not the full tree. The
/// payload is bounded on write (a capped number of roots, a capped number of folders each) so a user
/// who drills into many folders cannot grow the file without limit.</para>
/// <para>This is a serialization DTO — plain settable properties so <c>System.Text.Json</c> can
/// round-trip it. It is machine-specific by nature (absolute paths and sizes on THIS disk), which is
/// why it is NOT part of Profile Export: a delta from another PC's disk would be meaningless here.</para>
