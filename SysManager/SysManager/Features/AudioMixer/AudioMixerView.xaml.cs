    // tick does not overwrite the value mid-adjust (the thumb/value would jump to a stale
    // snapshot). A slider is "being adjusted" while EITHER a mouse drag is in progress OR it
    // holds keyboard focus (arrow-key / track-click fine-tuning). These two sources are tracked
    // independently and OR'd, so ending a mouse drag does NOT clear the guard while the slider
    // still has keyboard focus (the drag-then-arrow-key workflow). View-only concern (routed
    // input events), so it lives in code-behind.
