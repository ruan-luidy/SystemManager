/// Collects the evidence a bug report needs into a single zip the user chooses where to save.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Producing that evidence used to take four manual steps: copy the environment block, export the full
/// report, then leave the app, open <c>%LOCALAPPDATA%\SysManager\logs\</c> in Explorer and work out which of
/// up to fourteen daily rolling files covers the moment the bug happened. The target user cannot do the last
/// two, so their bug was simply unreportable (#1650).
/// <para><b>Nothing is uploaded, ever.</b> This writes a file to a path the user picked and stops. There is
/// no network code in this class and there is not going to be any — the bundle is something they attach if
/// they choose to, which is what keeps it inside the no-telemetry promise rather than a hole in it.</para>
/// <para>The report inside is the SHARABLE one, with the adapter MAC and the IPv4 host part removed. A MAC
/// address is permanent and cannot be un-published, and this bundle is built specifically to be posted in a
/// public thread — so redacting it is not caution, it is the difference between a safe artifact and a trap.
/// The logs need no such treatment: the sink strips the Windows user name from every line, message,
/// property and exception text alike, before it reaches disk.</para>
