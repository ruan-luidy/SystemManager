/// <summary>
/// ViewModel for the System Fixes tab — the one place in the app that repairs a broken Windows.
/// Surfaces Windows' own two general-purpose repairs (SFC and DISM /RestoreHealth), two targeted
/// ones (Windows Update, WinGet), plus a secure shortcut to the built-in auto-logon dialog. Each
/// repair confirms first, streams its output to the shared console, and reports its result
/// honestly. Repairs require administrator rights; the tab shows the standard elevation banner.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// SFC and DISM used to live on Quick Cleanup, whose own XAML called them "distinct from cleanup"
/// while the tab subtitle promised a 5-15 minute scan under the word "Quick" (#1493). A user who
/// reads tab names literally — the one this app is built for — opens System Fixes when something
/// is broken, and the two repairs most likely to fix it were on the tab named after housekeeping.
/// <para>Quick Cleanup keeps the component-store operations, and that is not an inconsistency:
/// <c>/AnalyzeComponentStore</c> and <c>/StartComponentCleanup</c> happen to be DISM too, but what
/// they do is reclaim disk space. The split here is by what the user is trying to achieve, not by
/// which executable does it.</para>
/// <para>Network-stack reset (Winsock/TCP-IP/DNS flush) lives on the Network Repair tab, which owns
/// it, so it is not duplicated here — the card list carries a pointer to it instead.</para>
