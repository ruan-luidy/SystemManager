    /// (#1496). Telling someone their disk is failing and leaving them to find the right tab among 58
    /// behind 11 collapsed groups creates the anxiety without the path.
    /// <para>An id rather than a command: a model carrying an <c>ICommand</c> would put the shell inside
    /// the model, while a string keeps the model a description of the finding. The view model owns the
    /// navigation, and <c>ArchitectureTests.EveryNavIdWrittenInTheApp_ResolvesToARealTab</c> pins that
    /// these ids resolve.</para>
    /// <para>That an id RESOLVES is not the same as it being the RIGHT one. This property was assigned
    /// twice in a row for the Event Log alert, with two different real tabs, and the resolve guard was
    /// satisfied by both (#2359) — so the button opened a page that did not list the events it counted.
