/// TCP/IP + UDP/IP network keyword and accumulates per-process send/receive byte counts from the
/// <c>TcpIpSend</c>/<c>TcpIpRecv</c>/<c>UdpIpSend</c>/<c>UdpIpRecv</c> events (plus their IPv6
/// variants). Each <see cref="SampleAsync"/> converts the bytes accumulated since the previous
/// call into per-process download/upload rates — the same figures Task Manager's Network column

/// A kernel session needs administrator, so this is only constructed when the app is already
/// elevated and the user opts in. It is defensive by construction: if the session can't start
/// (missing privilege, a stale same-named session, a locked-down host, or the native
/// KernelTraceControl helper failing to load), <see cref="Start"/> returns false and
/// <see cref="IsAvailable"/> stays false so the ViewModel silently falls back to the no-admin
/// <see cref="ConnectionBandwidthSource"/> — the tab never crashes because ETW was unavailable.
