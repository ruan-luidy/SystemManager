/// Which exceptions count as "the pipeline was stopped" — the detail that made #2206 invisible locally and
/// permanent on CI.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Cancelling a PowerShell run calls <c>ps.Stop()</c>, and the exception that surfaces depends on WHERE the
/// pipeline ran. In an in-process runspace <c>EndInvoke</c> throws <see cref="PipelineStoppedException"/>
/// directly. In the out-of-process Windows PowerShell 5.1 child reached over remoting, the failure comes back
/// as a <see cref="RemoteException"/> carrying a serialized copy. At the time only elevated sessions used the
/// child; since #2476 every session does, and the in-process shape is what an injected test runspace raises.
///
/// <para>The runner's translation arm named the in-process type only, so on an elevated runspace it never
/// matched and cancellation escaped as a raw PowerShell error rather than as
/// <c>OperationCanceledException</c>. A developer machine ran unelevated and could not see that; CI runs as
/// an administrator and hit it repeatedly, reporting
/// <c>RemoteException (The pipeline has been stopped.)</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>These are unit tests over the predicate rather than integration tests over a real remote failure,
/// because producing one needs an elevated host. That is the point: the shape CI produced is asserted here
/// on any machine, at no cost, instead of being discoverable only by shipping.</para>
