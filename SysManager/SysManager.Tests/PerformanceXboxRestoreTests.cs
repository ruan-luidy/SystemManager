/// Regression guard for the Xbox Game Bar restore bug: snapshot restore used to
/// collapse the two INDEPENDENT registry values — AppCaptureEnabled (Game Bar
/// overlay) and GameDVR_Enabled (per-game DVR) — into a single value via
/// <c>bar &amp;&amp; dvr</c>, which left one key in the wrong state on restore whenever
/// the user had them set differently (e.g. Bar ON / DVR OFF).
///
/// The registry writes themselves are system-level (integration), but the bug was
/// in the value MAPPING, which is pure: the snapshot must carry both flags
/// independently and restore must feed each to its own key. These tests pin that
/// the snapshot preserves the two flags separately for every combination — a
/// re-introduction of a single collapsed bool would break the round-trip.
