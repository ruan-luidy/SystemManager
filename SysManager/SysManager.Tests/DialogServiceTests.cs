/// Unit tests for <see cref="DialogService"/>. The MessageBox paths need a live WPF
/// Application and belong to UI automation, so what is pinned here is the headless

// Serialized: Instance_RejectsNull touches the static DialogService.Instance. The assignment is
// rejected, so nothing is actually swapped — but the read-then-restore still races a parallel class
// that IS mid-swap, which would restore that class's substitute after it had finished with it.

    // deliberately out of scope for unit tests (see the class summary). But the safe default is a
    // one-argument difference that compiles either way and stays invisible until someone presses Enter
    // over a file-shredder prompt — so the shipped source is what gets pinned, the same way the
    // XAML-binding guards work. All 76 confirmation call sites in the app go through Confirm.
