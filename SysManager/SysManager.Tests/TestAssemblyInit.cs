/// This exists because per-test discipline demonstrably does not hold. The activity log had a
/// <c>configDir</c> seam AND a test suite that used it correctly — and the real
/// <c>%LocalAppData%\SysManager\activity.json</c> still ended up holding twenty entries, all of them
/// DNS changes, six inside a single 60-millisecond window: <c>DnsHostsViewModelTests</c> driving
/// <c>ApplyDnsCommand</c> through a ViewModel that logs via <c>Instance</c>. At
/// <see cref="ActivityLogService.MaxEntries"/> that evicted the user's genuine history entirely. The
/// seam was never the missing piece — the singleton at the call site was (#1772).

/// A module initializer is the only placement a new test cannot forget. Adding a

/// (<see cref="ActivityLogScope"/>, <c>DialogAnswer</c>) remain the right tool when a test needs to
/// ASSERT on what was written; this is the floor underneath them.
