/// <para>`SettingsWatchdogViewModel.Watched` was populated in the constructor and bound by nothing, so
/// the tab rendered only settings that had already drifted. Before a drift the page held the heading,
/// the intro sentence — which names four of the eight watched settings as examples — and an empty
/// state. A user could not find out what the watchdog covers without reading the source.</para>
/// <para>A view-model test cannot catch that: `Watched` was correctly populated the whole time, and
/// every test of it would have passed. The absence existed only in the markup, which is why this
/// asserts against the shipped XAML — the same approach as
/// <c>AboutViewModelTests.AboutView_RendersTheRollbackButtonAndItsStatus</c> and the reachability
/// ratchet in <c>ArchitectureTests</c>, neither of which covers a collection.</para>
