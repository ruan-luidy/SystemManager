/// <remarks>
/// <para>The gate itself is deliberate and stays — <c>CanUninstall</c> requires an unelevated process so
/// each app's own uninstaller can raise its own UAC prompt. What was wrong was how the tab said so. It
/// used the identical gold <c>WarningBgSubtle</c> banner that the other 30 tabs use to mean "you are
/// elevated, so you can now do more", and filled it with "Uninstall is disabled in administrator
/// sessions. Reopen SysManager normally to continue." Two problems in one control: the colour promised
/// more access while the words removed it, and the instruction asked for something the app cannot help
/// with — there is no de-elevation path anywhere in the codebase, only
/// <c>AdminHelper.RelaunchAsAdmin</c>, which goes one way.</para>
/// <para>Asserted against the shipped markup because that is the only place the defect existed: every
/// view-model test passed throughout, since <c>CanUninstall</c> was behaving exactly as written.
/// <c>ArchitectureTests.EveryGoldElevationBanner_PromisesMoreAccess</c> guards the colour convention
/// across all views; this file pins THIS banner's copy, which that check cannot see once the banner is
/// no longer gold.</para>
