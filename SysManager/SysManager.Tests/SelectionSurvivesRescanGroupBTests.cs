/// <summary>
/// A rescan must keep the ticks the user set in Debloater, Uninstaller and App Blocker (#2304, group B).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// These three are the milder half of the class. Their rows arrive UNSELECTED, so a refresh cleared the
/// selection rather than reversing it: the Remove / Uninstall / Unblock button simply stopped doing anything
/// until every row was ticked again. Nothing here could act on a row the user had excluded, which is why
/// they were fixed after the four that could.
/// <para>All three services are concrete, and one of the three call sites is a private method reached only
/// from a real scan, so the KEY each tab uses is asserted against <see cref="SelectionCarry"/> directly —
/// the shared body's own behaviour is covered by <c>SelectionCarryTests</c>, so what is worth pinning here
/// is the identity each tab chose, which is the part that differs and the part that is easy to get wrong.
/// A source guard holds all three call sites.</para>
