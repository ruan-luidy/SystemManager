/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The chain policy used to be written out twice — once in <c>SpeedTestService.VerifyOoklaSignature</c> for
/// a third-party download and once in <c>UpdateService.VerifyAuthenticode</c> for our own installer. Two
/// copies of a security policy drift in the way that matters least visibly: a weakened revocation mode in
/// one of them changes the posture while every test stays green, because nothing compares them.
/// <para>What can be asserted by execution here is the three-way split
/// <see cref="Authenticode.ReadSigner"/> returns, which is the part both callers depend on and disagree
/// about. Chain validation itself needs a genuinely signed file with a controllable publisher — a test
/// certificate and signtool, which this project does not have — so that half is pinned against the source,
/// with the limitation stated rather than papered over.</para>
