/// <summary>
/// A block an OLDER build already wrote is recognised, described, and never silently repaired.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// #2030 stopped the app CREATING an IFEO block on <c>consent.exe</c>. It did nothing for a machine that
/// already had one, and that is the case that strands somebody: unblocking writes to HKLM, which needs
/// elevation, which needs the consent UI the block disabled. Such an entry used to appear in the blocked
/// list as an ordinary row beside the deliberate ones (#2357).
/// <para>The damage is reproduced the way it actually happened — the value written STRAIGHT INTO the hive,
/// bypassing <see cref="AppBlockerService.TryBlockApp"/>, because today's code refuses to write it. A test
/// that went through the service could not set this state up at all, which is precisely why the gap
/// survived: the only supported path already refuses, so nothing exercised the unsupported one.</para>
