/// <summary>
/// The time axis never prints a label for a value that cannot be a sample time.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Reported externally in #2371, with a screenshot: on a machine with no temperature sensors the Resource
/// History temperature chart showed <c>01-01 00:00</c> repeated across its whole X axis. The guard was
/// <c>v &gt; 0</c>, which admits any positive tick count — and a few ticks is a date in the year 1, which
/// formats as exactly that. With no samples the axis has no range to work from, so it laid its ticks near
/// zero and every one of them rendered the same year-1 string.
/// <para>Hiding the empty chart is the primary fix and lives in the view. This is the second line: whatever
/// range the axis invents, a label that cannot be a real sample time renders as nothing.</para>
