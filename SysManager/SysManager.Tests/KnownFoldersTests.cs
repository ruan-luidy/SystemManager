/// <summary>
/// Tests for <see cref="KnownFolders"/> — verifies the SHGetKnownFolderPath wrapper
/// still resolves real, rooted folder paths after switching to manual PWSTR
/// marshalling (the previous <c>out string</c> form leaked the CoTaskMem buffer per
/// call; the wrapper now frees it itself). Assertions stay environment-independent:
/// every Windows profile resolves these to a non-empty rooted path (either the
/// relocated Known Folder or the SpecialFolder fallback), so they don't depend on a
/// particular folder existing on a headless CI runner.
