/// The walk every destructive service uses, so every rule that makes it safe is tested once.

/// <remarks>
/// These cases were spread across <c>TuneUpServiceTests</c> and <c>ShortcutCleanerViewModelTests</c>, each
/// exercising one of five hand-copied walkers. Testing the walk in one place is the point of there being one
/// walk: two of those copies were missing rules the others had (#2376, #2380), and per-service tests could
/// not have caught that — each copy passed its own tests.
/// <para>Symlink creation needs Developer Mode or elevation. Those cases skip rather than fail when it is
/// unavailable, which is why the reparse rules are ALSO asserted through <see cref="SafeFileWalk.IsReparsePoint"/>
/// on a path that cannot be read: that half needs no privilege and cannot silently stop running.</para>
