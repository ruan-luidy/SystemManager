/// Points <see cref="ActivityLogService.Instance"/> at a throwaway directory for the life of the

/// without appending to the developer's real activity history.
/// <para>
/// The restore matters for the same reason it does in <see cref="DialogAnswer"/>: the singleton is
/// process-wide static state, so a test that swapped it and threw would leak the temp instance into
/// every later test in the collection.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This exists because the seam alone was not enough. <see cref="ActivityLogService"/> already took a
/// <c>configDir</c>, but <c>Instance</c> was get-only, so the 20+ ViewModel call sites that log
/// through the singleton had no way to reach it. The evidence was in the file: a real
/// <c>activity.json</c> holding twenty entries, every one of them a DNS change, six inside a single
/// 60-millisecond window — <c>DnsHostsViewModelTests</c> driving <c>ApplyDnsCommand</c>, not a person.
/// At <see cref="ActivityLogService.MaxEntries"/> that had evicted the user's genuine history
