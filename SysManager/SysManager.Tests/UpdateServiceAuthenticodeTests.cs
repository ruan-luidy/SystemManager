/// Regression tests for <see cref="UpdateService.VerifyAuthenticode"/>.

/// The bug: <c>X509Certificate.CreateFromSignedFile</c> THROWS
/// <c>CryptographicException</c> (HResult 0x80092009, CRYPT_E_NO_MATCH) on a file
/// with no embedded Authenticode signature — it does not return null. The old code
/// only returned <c>true</c> from the null branch (which is unreachable) and turned
/// every unsigned file into <c>false</c> via the catch. Since SysManager ships
/// unsigned builds, that made the in-app updater abort EVERY install with
/// "invalid digital signature — possible tampering". These tests pin that an
/// unsigned file is now accepted (true), so the update flow is no longer blocked.

/// (File integrity is enforced separately by the SHA256 check, which runs first.)
