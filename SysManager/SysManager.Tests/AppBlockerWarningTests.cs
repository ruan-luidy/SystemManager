/// <summary>
/// The rescue banner the App Blocker tab shows for a block it cannot lift, and what it says.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The wording is asserted, not just the flag, because the whole value of this feature is in the words:
/// somebody stranded without an elevation prompt needs the registry location, and an elevated user needs
/// to be told to use the button instead. A banner that showed the wrong one of those two would be worse
/// than none — it would send a stuck user to a button that cannot work (#2357).
/// <para><c>IsElevated</c> is set explicitly and the list re-read afterwards, rather than being taken from
/// <c>AdminHelper.IsElevated()</c>: the real value depends on how the test host was launched, so leaving it
/// alone would make exactly one of the two branches run and which one would vary by machine.</para>
