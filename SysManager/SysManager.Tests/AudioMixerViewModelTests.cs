/// hardware is touched. Coverage targets the ViewModel logic that matters: the in-place
/// reconcile (surviving rows keep their instance, adds/removes without a collection Reset
/// — pinning the "ReplaceWith drops the dragged slider" trap), volume/mute propagation to
/// the service with an echo-suppression guard on external updates, the mid-drag guard, the
/// identity refresh, the peak-meter update path (batched into ONE service call, off the UI
/// thread, and guarded against a Dispose landing mid-sample), the empty-state flag, and
/// deterministic disposal. The <c>IsActive</c> gate is verified only for the peak-meter half
/// (the zeroing on the way out); both loops' pause-when-hidden branches are delay-driven and
/// are not unit-tested (they would need a time seam). The COM enumeration and
/// grouping itself lives in <see cref="AudioMixerService"/>
