/// <remarks>
/// Those seven statements are the strongest claims the project makes to someone deciding whether to run a
/// privileged utility, and until now not one of them was enforced by anything. A refactor that added a
/// registry delete to the cleanup engine, or an <c>HttpClient</c> to a diagnostics path, would have shipped
/// green while falsifying a published security promise. One of the seven was already a documented manual
/// step — Gate-REVIEW says to grep the diff for network calls in any diagnostics or export path — which is
/// exactly the kind of rule that survives only as long as someone remembers it.
/// <para><b>Every guard here carries a measured floor</b>, because every one is a "no match" assertion and
/// a no-match assertion is what passes silently when its pattern rots. The floors are counts re-derived
/// against the current source; if one stops being met the guard fails and says the detection broke, rather
/// than reporting clean.</para>
/// <para><b>Comments are stripped before any code assertion.</b> This codebase documents what it
/// deliberately does NOT touch, naming the very files and paths these guards forbid — the password-store
/// filenames appear only inside such comments. A guard reading them as code would fail on the explanation
