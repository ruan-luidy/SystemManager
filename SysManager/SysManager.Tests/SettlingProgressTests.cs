/// <summary>
/// Tests for <see cref="SettlingProgress{T}"/> — that a report raised while an operation runs reaches the
/// handler, and that one raised after it has ended does not, whichever way it ended.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Every other test in this project uses <see cref="SyncProgress{T}"/> and constructs no
/// <see cref="Progress{T}"/> at all, because asynchronous delivery is never the thing being measured there —
/// it only makes the assertion race the report. Here it IS the thing being measured, so delivery is made
/// synchronous through a <see cref="SynchronizationContext"/> that runs a post inline: the report has
/// therefore either arrived or been dropped by the time <c>Report</c> returns, and nothing waits on a clock.
/// <c>SettlingProgress</c> captures that context in its own constructor, so every reporter here is built
/// inside <see cref="WithInlineDelivery"/> rather than as a field.</para>
/// <para>What these cannot reach is the lock: proving that a report already inside the handler completes
/// before the settle takes effect needs the two to overlap, and every deterministic way to arrange that
/// reduces to asserting that something did not happen within some number of milliseconds. That is the timing
/// dependence the testing rules exist to keep out, so the reason the lock spans the handler is recorded in
/// the primitive instead of pinned here.</para>
