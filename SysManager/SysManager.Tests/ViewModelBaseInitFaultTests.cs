/// <summary>
/// The boundary that catches a constructor's fire-and-forget init keeps its promise for EVERY exception
/// type, not the six it happened to name.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <c>RunInitAsync</c>'s summary promised that "exceptions are caught and logged instead of becoming
/// unobserved task exceptions", and nothing ever tested it. It caught six types; everything else escaped —
/// and escaping was invisible, because nothing in production awaits <c>InitializationComplete</c>, so the
/// fault sat on a task that is rooted by that very property and therefore never finalized. The
/// <c>TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException</c> handler <c>App</c> wires up fires from the finalizer, so it
/// never ran. The tab just stayed half-loaded (#2258).
/// <para>How it was found is the reason these tests exist at all: making one unrelated test await the init
/// turned two long-passing tests red with a <c>NullReferenceException</c> from
/// <c>DebloaterService.ParsePackages</c> that had been thrown on every launch. The only way to notice was to
/// await a task production never awaits.</para>
/// <para>Asserted through <see cref="ViewModelBase.InitializationFault"/> rather than through the log,
/// because reading what Serilog wrote means assigning the global <c>Log.Logger</c> that every test in the
/// run shares — which <c>LogServiceLogDirTests</c> spells out as the thing not to do. The property is also
/// the stronger assertion: it says which exception was caught, not merely that a line was written.</para>
