/// <remarks>
/// The tab loads the real process list when it is built and then reconciles it into <c>Processes</c> every second.
/// A test that adds a row and looks for it again must not share that collection with the loop, so the first load
/// is awaited and the loop parked through <c>IsActive</c>. That first load reads every running process and its
/// icon, about six seconds on the machine that measured it, which is why it happens once for the class rather than
/// once per test.
/// <para>The call that ends a process is injected and forwards to <see cref="Kill"/>, which each test sets, so
/// nothing real is ever ended.</para>
