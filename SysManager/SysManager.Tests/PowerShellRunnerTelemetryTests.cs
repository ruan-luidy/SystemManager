/// <remarks>
/// The runner hosts the PowerShell 7 SDK to drive its Windows PowerShell child, and <c>System.Management.Automation</c>
/// ships <c>Microsoft.ApplicationInsights</c> for its telemetry subsystem — resolved in the dependency graph and
/// bundled into the self-contained single-file .exe. PowerShell gates that subsystem on one environment
/// variable and nothing else, so the opt-out is the whole defence and deserves a test rather than trust.
