/// <summary>
/// Tests that a Deep Cleanup rescan keeps the ticks the user set (#2301).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The scan summary tells the user to "untick anything you want to keep", and then a rescan re-ticked all
/// of it: categories arrive from the service pre-selected and the view model replaced the whole collection.
/// <c>RefreshOnF5</c> is <c>ScanCommand</c>, so pressing F5 was enough.
/// <para>The carry-forward is tested directly rather than through the command, because
/// <c>DeepCleanupService</c> is concrete and a scan walks the real filesystem — driving the command would
/// make these assertions depend on what happens to be in the machine's temp folders. The last test holds
/// the view model to actually calling it, so the logic cannot end up correct and orphaned.</para>
