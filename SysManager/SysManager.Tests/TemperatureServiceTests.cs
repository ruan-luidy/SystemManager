/// The other three fixes in the same change are not reachable from a unit test and are not pretended to be:
/// opening LibreHardwareMonitor loads a kernel driver, the WMI disk-name query needs live WMI, and the
/// storage-temperature time-to-live sits behind <see cref="DiskHealthService"/>, which is sealed with a
