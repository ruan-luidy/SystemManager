/// <remarks>
/// The report is the app's own answer to "produce evidence for a bug" — SUPPORT.md, the issue template and
/// the About tab's "Report a problem" button all funnel someone toward attaching one — and a MAC address is
/// permanent: it survives a Windows reinstall and cannot be un-published once it is in a GitHub thread. All
/// three formats carried both fields, undisclosed, and the HTML footer reassured the reader that "no data
/// leaves this machine", which is true of the application and beside the point for a file meant to be sent
/// to somebody (#2352).
/// <para>Redaction now happens in <c>GenerateDataAsync</c>, the single point every format passes through,
/// rather than in each renderer. These tests exercise the helper and the renderers over it; the guard that
/// no format can BYPASS that point is
