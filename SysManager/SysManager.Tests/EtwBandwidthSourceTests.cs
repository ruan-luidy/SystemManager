/// Tests for <see cref="EtwBandwidthSource"/>'s bookkeeping — the parts that need no kernel ETW session.
/// <para>The session itself requires administrator and is refused cleanly when absent (<c>Start</c> returns
/// false), so these drive the accumulate path directly through the <c>internal</c> <c>Add</c> seam and read
/// results through <c>SampleAsync</c>, with an injected clock instead of real waiting. What is covered is
/// the PID-eviction contract added for #1816: before it, <c>_counters</c> was cleared only in
/// <c>Dispose</c>, so every PID the session ever saw stayed in a per-tick allocate-and-two-key-sort for the
/// tab's whole lifetime.</para>
/// <para>The COM/ETW subscription and the rate arithmetic itself are not covered here — the former needs a
/// real elevated session, the latter lives in <c>BandwidthFormat</c> and is tested in
/// <see cref="BandwidthFormatTests"/>.</para>
