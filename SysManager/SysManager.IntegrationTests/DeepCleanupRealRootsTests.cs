/// <remarks>
/// Everything else moved the other way. Until #2176 the unit project scanned the real disk for all of it,
/// which cost 183 seconds on a workstation with real caches and — worse — meant the assertions could only
/// be shapes that hold anywhere. With <c>ICleanupRoots</c> the unit tests point at a tree they build and
/// assert exact counts in 0.25 seconds; what is left over is this, and it belongs here, where a
/// live-system dependency is the point of the project rather than a compromise.
/// <para>Deliberately narrow. Neither test asserts that any particular folder EXISTS — a fresh runner has
/// almost none of them — only that the definitions were built from the machine's own paths and that the
/// walk completes. A test that required content would fail on CI and pass on a developer's machine for
/// reasons neither chose, which is the state this replaced.</para>
