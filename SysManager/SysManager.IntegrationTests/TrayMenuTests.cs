/// The tray context menu's structure: what it contains, in what order, and what it omits.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Integration rather than unit because a <see cref="ContextMenu"/> is a <c>DispatcherObject</c> and cannot
/// be constructed off an STA thread. It stops short of <c>TrayIconService.Initialize</c>, which calls
/// <c>ForceCreate</c> and registers an icon with the Windows notification area — the menu itself is ordinary
/// WPF and needs nothing from the shell.
/// <para>Order is asserted, not just membership. The CPU readout sits directly above "What's using my PC"
/// on purpose: the header says the CPU is at 80%, and the next item answers what is using it. Membership
/// alone would pass with the two separated, which is the whole design gone (#1589).</para>
