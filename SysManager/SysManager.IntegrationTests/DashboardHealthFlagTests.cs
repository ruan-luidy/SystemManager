/// <c>LoadHealthScoreAsync</c> is not a command, only the init path calls it, and that path also starts the
/// polling loops and queries WMI. <c>DashboardViewModelTests</c>' own summary says WMI-touching dashboard
/// work lives in this project; the unit suite keeps the "starts false" half, which needs no scan.
