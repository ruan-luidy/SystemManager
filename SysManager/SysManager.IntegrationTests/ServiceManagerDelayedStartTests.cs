/// <summary>
/// Proves the Services scan reads the delayed-start flag Windows actually reports (#2428), by comparing every
/// row with WMI's own view of the same services.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The unit suite pins what the flag does once it is on a row — the snapshot, the ledger, the sc.exe token —
/// with the flag handed to it. None of that shows the scan ever sets it: a native query that failed for every
/// service would leave every row "not delayed", which is the bug being fixed, and every unit test would stay
/// green. WMI's <c>Win32_Service</c> is the independent reading: services.msc's "Automatic (Delayed Start)" is
/// <c>StartMode = Auto</c> with <c>DelayedAutoStart = true</c>.
/// <para>The comparison is what caught the first design. Reading each service's <c>DelayedAutostart</c>
/// registry value disagreed with WMI for a per-user service instance, which has no value of its own and takes
/// its template's — so the scan asks the service control manager instead.</para>
/// <para>Read-only, and needs no elevation. Assertions report counts only: a failure message ends up in a
/// public CI log, and the service names on the machine running it are not something to publish.</para>
