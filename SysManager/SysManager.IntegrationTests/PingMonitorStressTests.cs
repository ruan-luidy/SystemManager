        // The churn deliberately never touches "base" — only 192.0.2.2-253 hosts — so
        // it survives as a fixed point we can assert on after the storm settles. "base"
        // stays enabled, so the pump is genuinely pinging while the map churns under it.
        //
        // Two things here are load-bearing rather than tidiness, and both were measured
        // on #2195. This test used to spin unthrottled for two seconds against a
        // CancellationTokenSource, with the churned targets left ENABLED.
        //
        // ENABLED was the expensive half. PumpAsync snapshots
        // `Targets.Values.Where(t => t.IsEnabled …)` every tick, so a disabled target is
        // still enumerated — the concurrent add/remove still races that snapshot, which
        // is the entire point of this test — but it is never pinged. With them enabled the
        // map filled with ~250 hosts and the pump fired thousands of fire-and-forget ICMP
        // operations at unroutable addresses, all abandoned mid-flight when Stop()
        // cancelled the token. The suite runs maxParallelThreads=1, so those continuations
        // drained through one worker AFTER this test returned, and the bill landed on
        // whichever test ran next: ToggleIsEnabled_MidFlight_IsRespected measured 283s
        // against 1.2s of intended Task.Delay, and 336s on a slow run. Past 300s it
        // crossed --hangdump-timeout 5m, the runner wrote a 704 MB dump, and the hang-dump
        // extension's DisposeAsync then timed out and reported `Failed!` with `failed: 0`
        // on 8 of 60 runs. Disabling them moved that test to 7.64s.
        //
        // UNTHROTTLED was the unstable half, and disabling the targets alone did not fix
        // it — it relocated it. The two-second spin measured ~27 MILLION add/remove
        // operations, i.e. ~14 million ConcurrentDictionary writes a second alongside a
        // pump snapshotting the same dictionary every tick, and the cost of that was never
        // stable: the same runner image measured this pair at 4s + 283s, then at 217s + 8s.
        // Interleaving is what proves thread safety, not iteration count, so the churn is
        // bounded on OPERATIONS and yields between batches — a fixed ~20k operations
        // spread across several pump ticks, at a cost that does not depend on how fast the
        // machine happens to be.
        //
        // Yes, that is an awaited delay in a test, which ArchitectureTests.NoTestWaitsBySleeping
        // forbids — and that guard is scoped to the blocking unit suite, deliberately, not to
        // this project. The rule exists because a unit test must not assert how fast the
        // machine is. Here the subject under test IS a timer: PumpAsync ticks on Interval, so
        // the churn has to span ticks to race the snapshot at all, and Task.Yield() would
        // finish all 20k operations before the pump ticked once. The delay is what makes this
        // test's cost machine-INdependent rather than dependent on it.
