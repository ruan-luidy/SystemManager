/// Integration rather than unit, because the only assertion worth making runs against the real adapters: a
/// canned report can only prove that a pattern which was never there is still not there. The bundle exists to
/// be attached to a public issue (#1650), a MAC address is permanent and survives a Windows reinstall, and
/// nobody can withdraw one once it is posted — so this is the test that makes the bundle safe rather than
/// merely intended to be safe.
/// <para><b>No failure message here prints an identifier.</b> A failing assertion's text goes into the CI log,
