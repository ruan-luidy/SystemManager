/// <remarks>
/// This lives in the integration suite rather than the unit one because it is a genuine system dependency:
/// it needs the machine's catalog store, and there is no way to fake one. The unit suite covers the HRESULT
/// mapping and the member-tag formatting, which is where the decisions are.
/// <para><b>It exists because the unit suite structurally could not catch the defect it guards.</b> Every
/// unit test writes its own temp file, and no file a test can create is catalog-signed — so a catalog
/// lookup that silently returned "no signature" for everything would pass the entire unit suite. Reporting
/// <c>powershell.exe</c> as unsigned is exactly what shipped for three releases.</para>
