/// <summary>
/// Runs the exact scripts <see cref="RestorePointService"/> builds in a real Windows PowerShell 5.1 — the engine every
/// SysManager runspace uses — with the restore-point cmdlets shadowed by local functions (#2436, #2476).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// A function takes precedence over a cmdlet of the same name, so each stub stands in for Windows' answer and System
/// Restore is never touched: nothing here needs elevation or changes the machine. What is under test is PowerShell's
/// own semantics, which a substituted runner cannot show. The bug was one of them: Windows reports its one-a-day limit
/// as a WARNING, <c>-ErrorAction Stop</c> ignores warnings, and so the script printed its success sentinel for a
/// restore point that was never made.
/// <para>The succeeding stubs are the positive controls: without them, a script that never printed its sentinel at all
/// would pass every refusal case. Every script starts with <see cref="WindowsPowerShellScript.StubsInEffect"/>, because
/// CI's runner is elevated: a stub that failed to shadow the real <c>Restore-Computer</c> there would restore it.</para>
