/// contract. That a cancelled scan THROWS is pinned in the unit project instead — see
/// <c>ArchitectureTests.EveryScanThatBreaksOnCancellation_ThrowsBeforeReturning</c> — because this scan
/// takes no progress callback, so there is no deterministic point at which a test can cancel it: on a
/// machine with no browser profiles it finishes in microseconds and would legitimately beat the cancel.
/// A test that accepted "either outcome" would pass against the unfixed code, which is what it must not do.

    /// <c>Task.Run(…, ct)</c> refuses to invoke the delegate for an already-cancelled token and the await
    /// throws before the body is reached, whatever the body does. So the guard in the unit project checks
    /// the clean path's SHAPE, and this covers the ordinary path it must not break.
