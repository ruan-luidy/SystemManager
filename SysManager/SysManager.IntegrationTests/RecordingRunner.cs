/// <summary>
/// An <see cref="IPowerShellRunner"/> that counts what it was asked to run, runs none of it, and can raise
/// its own output events on demand.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Hand-rolled rather than substituted: this project does not reference NSubstitute, and pulling a second
/// mocking dependency in — plus the row it would need in TESTING.md's framework table — is a larger change
/// than the counter its callers actually need.
/// <para>Every run member increments the SAME <see cref="Calls"/> counter, because the assertions it serves
/// ask "did anything run at all", not which overload stayed untouched. <see cref="RaiseLine"/> and
/// <see cref="RaiseProgress"/> exist because two of the seams under test are pure pass-throughs
/// (<c>WingetService.LineReceived</c> forwards add/remove straight to the runner), and the only way to see a
/// pass-through work is to raise the far end and watch the near end fire.</para>
