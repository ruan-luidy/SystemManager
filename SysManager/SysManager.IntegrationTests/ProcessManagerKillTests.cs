/// processes around the one being ended, and only Windows can show that.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The subject is a <c>cmd.exe</c> whose child is a Windows PowerShell that prints its own process ID and then
/// echoes each line it reads. The child shares the parent's redirected pipes. So the test learns the child's ID
/// without searching for it, and proves the child is alive by getting an answer from it. A dead child closes the
/// pipe, so the read returns end-of-stream at once rather than waiting out a timeout. Nothing sleeps.
/// <para>The child is held through a handle taken while it is known to be alive, so the clean-up cannot reach a
/// different process that was given the same ID later.</para>
